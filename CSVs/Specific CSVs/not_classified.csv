Our house is a double property, the delivery is to my grandma in the smaller house, so I understand being confused on what gate to enter in. My problem is each time we get a delivery PEOPLE LEAVE THE GATE OPEN. Our dogs have almost gotten hit, we’ve gotten threats from animal control, so please. Our dogs have gotten out multiple times now and we’re not sure who to contact to try to put a note or something. The gates kinda hard to close, it’s not a main entry we use often, we understand. Tonight, however, both doors were WIDE OPEN. That’s not okay people please at least TRY to close the gate so our dogs have a harder time escaping."

What I do know  is that she was going  to town  with it, like  knuckle deep. I do have a security video and screenshots of the incident that I would be elated to share. The thought of somebody's feces being on the container of something I just ate is quite repulsive. Especially in a time where we have an epidemic in our hands.

The Instacart shoppers come into the store during the pandemic and completely disregard the protocols in place to keep people safe and healthy. They don't respect the elderly designated shopping times-they don't maintain social distance, NEVER abide by the one way isle directions and if you ask them to respect the store's procedure they swear back at you. I have asked BIGY to address the matter but they refuse to keep their regular shoppers happy. I will NEVER use INSTACART  and will shop at the local Roche Brother's going forward. Cannot wait for this pandemic to be over and watch all the businesses like Instacart go out of business."

In my opinion that is not fair to us as driver’s. I understand that the tips have to go through in 1 day but not being able to cash out when i need gas money to make those runs isn’t fair. I was out for 5 hours yesterday after after my regular day job shopping for other people using my own gas while being cold. It is not fair to me that i cant cash out the money i made. This company is a joke. I did my job, Instacart needs to be fair and do their job and do right by their delivery drivers."

Instacart 'promises' IN WRITING that shoppers will be forgiven for less than 5 star ratings due to app issues or other things which are out of their control BUT they DO NOT follow thru on that ever !!!  They tell you that you have to complete more and more batches (that are ridiculously long distant and low paying) in order for poor ratings to be removed.  Basically they use people and dispense of them on a regular basis because they are grotesquesly self serving and couldn't care less about the people who make it possible for them to make money.

The reason I bring this up is the fact that your ratings as customers do not affect these shoppers who cheat by using the 3rd party bot apps, therefore quality work from ""Instacart"" shoppers is out the window! I hope Instacart realizes how serious this problem is, that yes this will affect instacart's bottomline once too many customers are irritated by the influx of low quality shoppers who use these 3rd party bot apps, and that instacart WILL LOSE it's customers and good quality honest shoppers to competitors if it does NOT act quickly!!! I am one of those shoppers affected by these cheaters, I have a very high rating of 4.89 stars out of 5 stars yet i see all of the Seattle orders disappear in a fraction of a second, and many times i do not see any orders at all for hours! My sister is one of those angry customers who is being affected by these low quality shoppers who cheat using 3rd party bot apps! She has already given up on being a customer and has gone to Amazon Fresh. Shoppers using 3rd party bot apps that ignores customer ratings and screens orders before it gets to honest shoppers who don't use 3rd party bot apps continues to allow the low quality shoppers to be a main presence which is unfair to both the customers and the honest hard working shoppers. ATTENTION TO INSTACART: I REPEAT THAT YOU WILL DEFINITELY LOSE MANY CUSTOMERS IF YOU CONTINUE TO ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN!!"

The areas they serve are completely random.  I live less than 4 miles from the stores I want delivery from.  They don't deliver to my address yet they deliver to addresses 23 miles away.  I have to have delivery to someone else's address. I tried to get an override. I got the run-around from worthless agent to worthless agent for a week before insisting on a manager.  The verdict: there isn't anyone with the power of reason at instacart.  I had another incident where an obnoxious shopper delivered my groceries and got right in my face without a mask and ranted for 10 minutes regarding his right to do so.  I paid for the honor of risking infection.  This time it was more than a week dealing with instacart and nothing was ever done to curb this dangerous employee's behavior.

Some friends recommended trying it for Wegmans grocery delivery. So I entered that 'Next available time slot' option. I ordered it on a friday and it said groceries would be delivered between tuesday and saturday. That was fine with me, I expected a possible week waiting time because of the virus. Guess what, after waiting patiently alllll week for my groceries I checked my status now on Saturday, the last day of delivery. It is still listed as 'New' meaning nobody's currently looking for my groceries or even close to delivering it. You know what I have in my fridge? Water and a single radish. Because I wanted to do my part and stay home as much as possible I waited and waited and waited. Let me be clear when I say, I'd rather risk corona and go in person than ever try this service again. BS waste of time. (Also as an after note I didn't even realize there was a tip option, it was left as default. I saw on the news instacart shoppers are only shopping for those who tip a lot. That must've been the problem, which is honestly also BS.) This is a company which means someone has to fulfill the agreement even if they're not happy about getting a low tip (also as a sidenote I would've tipped a lot more than the default if I'd known it was there). What about the poor elderly who need groceries delivered and can't tip? Just going to leave them on 'New' and let them starve? Whole thing is crap, I will never order through it again."

The company is JUST NOW supplying them with hand sanitizer, and they aren't getting hazard pay, and tips are somehow not required during this time. Also, their paid sick leave that they boast about is only if they can prove they've tested positive for COVID 19, and we all know how hard it is to get tested in the US right now. I encourage you all to abstain from using IC right now until the employees demands are met. I am a member of Instacart Express and it has been a huge convenience to have. However, the shoppers that are on the frontlines have been the reason why I loved IC so much. They do the hard work and they deserve to be taken care of accordingly. If you are in a situation where you must use IC, PLEASE tip how you would want to be tipped if you were shopping and delivering strangers' groceries during a pandemic and your job didn't supply you with any safety equipment or health insurance.

I thought maybe it was just a minor mess up so I tried delivery again. This order at least arrived in my cul-de-sac. However, instead of verifying the house number, the deliverer walked to each houses‘ front door and asked them if they had groceries being delivered.

One time a drug pipe was left in one of my bags and my two year old child found it.  I have also had people accept my batches and then just never show up with anything at all and on two different occasions now I have caught druggy instacart shoppers doing their drugs in the driveway in front of my own home! One time they were snorting something and threw the baggy out of their car window (caught that one on camera) and the other time they were smoking something on what appeared to be aluminum foil which I also caught on camera. All of these times I contacted instacart. At first I was told they would look into these issues and the people responsible would be reprimanded. Now instacart tells me that even though I have supplied them proof of these issues that there is nothing they can do because they were not present to see these things happen for themselves. People do yourselves the favor for both you and your families and do not use this company to get your shopping done. Keep your family safe and do your own shopping at least then you know it will be done right and if you cant do the shopping yourselves pay someone you trust like a relative or a good friend to do it for you.

Some of us actually do this and immediately see all the hours get grabbed up. I was only able to grab like 2 shifts for the next 2 weeks. That alone would not be so terrible, ok I will just make a couple of bucks here and there on instacart. No folks, there is a strike 3. Instacart requires that you work 90 hours over a 3 week period in order to keep working with them. That would not be so bad however all the shifts have been taken by 9:01 am on sundays. Totally unrealistic parameters. I am willing to work 90 hours over 3 weeks, but all the shifts are taken. I say power to the people - we can't let companies like this succeed."
