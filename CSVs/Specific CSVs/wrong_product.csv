I get it, it happens and the shoppers probably have multiple orders they shop for. However, I placed an order for 8 items at Publix (Florida grocery store) that totaled $54.34. I see 3 different things added to my order that I DEFINITELY DID NOT add. The problem with these is the 3 of them combined cost $141.97. SO NOW my order totaled at $196.31. I took a screen shot of the added items and reached out to Erik (my shopper). I said why were these added I did not add these. His response ""Yes"".... So, my next message was ""I want the receipt for my order when you drop off the groceries""... Next notification I received seconds after that message to him was ""your order has been delivered"". I was literally standing out front in my driveway when that notification came through.I called customer service. BOY are they a joke. They answered, apologized and they said they would issue a full refund for my order and it would be deposited in 5-10 business days. I don't think it is fair I have to wait 5-10 business days for their shopper stealing from a customer and racking up the bill more than twice the amount I originally planned on spending and esp before Christmas. I still have Christmas presents to purchase, which this now sets me back a little. So, moving forward. I told the customer service representative I would like to take more action and calling the cops. The customer service rep kept repeating himself saying Instacart is handling it. So, if anything legal happens they don't give you any information whatsoever if you decide to escalate the situation to local authorities. I asked what their policy was regarding legalities. The customer service rep had no idea. Instacart is a multimillion possible multibillion dollar corporation with no policies regarding legalities. They just keep saying ""Instacart is taking care of it"". This raises concerns, esp if something drastic did ever happen. What if this shopper comes to my house (since he knows my address now) because I reported him and retaliates against me? What then? What happens at that point (god forbid it happens)? Instacart has no company policy in this regard. I now have to keep an eye on my bank account and hope they do in fact refund my money their shopper stole from me. I really do not recommend Instacart. I know it is convenient when you don't have the time to shop but when something like this happens it truly is not worth it. I run 2 successful shops on Etsy, when I issue a refund to a customer the money is deposited within 24-48 hours. I know Instacart can in fact have the money deposited quicker. They just choose not to."

WHAT THE HECK!?!?!?!?! I would have to pay more in delivery fees, service fees (YES, THEY HAVE MULTIPLE FEE CATEGORIES) and tips than the cost of the items, and would have to go through the same crap experience, to me this amounts to EXTORTION or STEALING. They charged me for items I didn't get, and now won't return the money unless I spend more with them. They take too many orders then blame high volume for poor customer service. I would happily pick a delivery window for a following day rather then get garbage service. Taking my money for a service you are too overbooked to provide is not ethical.If you contact them about multiple issues (in my case expensive items that I was charged for but never received and fresh vegetables waaayyy beyond the questionable stage - they were literally dissolving into disgusting goo) they will take several days to only address the first issue.A while back I tried using them to get my mother some groceries in another city, items were never delivered although they claim they were and we were charged and had to fight over a refund. She has a doorbell camera (so we have proof they didn't arrive) and an easy to identify/find apartment and we get deliveries from restaurants and such without issues all the time. I've tried using the app several times over the last year, thinking that perhaps they just needed time to adjust to the larger volume of Covid orders and I didn't want to give up on them in the middle of a crisis. But nothing is improving, if anything customer service is going downhill. I've been having much better luck with AMAZON FRESH and will use them exclusively for deliveries from now on. Highly recommend them. If you have an Amazon Prime Membership there are no delivery fees as well, WIN WIN!"

I was cheated in my supplies the first time. It was of poor quality and less Quantity. Next time I bought an electronic scale and checked. There was no need to check. the robbery was so evident. one Papaya was 2.8 Kg and an orange 1/2 Kg. Everything was not according to weight charged. When I reported to instacart, with a chart of charged weight and actual weight. I got a reply that intacart is refunding the short-changed/short supplied price difference. Nobody had the courtesy to explain daylight robbery. It is like if you catch a thief, instead of going to jail he agrees to return stolen goods but charges you for his time and effort in conducting the robbery. (like the fee and tip Charged) I checked their service only twice but they charged me C$112.00 yearly fee there is no reunfd option. I don't remember becoming or applying for membership.So the  supplies of around $100 has cost me about $130 in delivery charges. Plus time and and aggravation."

I have ordered from the company before.  They have delivered to the wrong address or given me the wrong item (cabbage instead of lettuce, etc.)  This time takes the cake.  My order from Costco was delivered 1 hour after it was promised.  I received one item out of 7.  Where did the other items go?  Where was my shopper?  The one item was delivered by a random delivery person.  Instacart has the potential to do great things.  Hire good people and train them.  It's not that difficult.  You have lost a customer."

Yes, they charge too much by marking up prices. My experience with drivers has been mostly good. I had one instance when there was items in my order that I didn't order, but I wasn't charged for them. I had another instance where there was items in my order that I didn't order and there were missing items from my order that I was charged for. I used the app to report my missing items, and I was refunded for them. The shopper on that trip had informed me she was shopping 2 orders at once. That should not be allowed, as that is probably how my order got screwed up, and probably the other customer's order as well. I emailed Instacart about not letting a shopper do 2 orders at once but all I got was a canned response ""I am sorry for the inconvenience ..."".On Thursday I tried placing a order for Friday delivery. I got a message that there was no time slots available until Monday! I check another store, it said the same thing, I checked all 34 stores on my app, all said the same thing. Now a logical person would deduce that there is something wrong with their scheduling system. I tried going on their online chat to report this. after 1.5 hours waiting I gave up and left. I sent an email instead. All I got was the canned response ""I am sorry for the inconvenience ..."". Their customer service reps cannot read and comprehend English, and have no idea how to apply logical thinking.I checked the app and the website on Saturday, all 34 stores still say next delivery on Monday. The system in my area has been broken for at least 3 days now. I checked ordering in other zipcodes of my state, scheduling orders are functioning normally. Instacart you deserve to fail."

But the items I ordered were not available and before I was even able to ask for an alternate option as the alternate option I already chose was also unavailable I still wasn’t able to change because the shopper went to checkout two seconds after advising me that it wasn’t available. On top of this my delivery was delayed over an hour. This is horrible. I still have to go out shopping because the main items that I need weren’t even picked up. This will be my last time using this service.

I took advantage of the November sales and placed a large order. My order was then altered/changed without my consent and upon emailing, I was told it was changed due to out of stock items.     Now there are no more sales, and they do not want to honor the original order and deliver once it is back in stock.  They will not give me the sales price on items I originally ordered.  I sent 5 emails, been getting the runaround, emails asked to describe in detail what happened....I did and would still get the same request from them (Representative will contact you, please describe in detail....). I then called and was on the phone for 30 minutes with Angelie.  I explained to her the issue back and forth, she would not honor the original order at the original sales price, she said I can reorder, but will have to pay non sales price.  I asked her to honor the sales price and deliver once it is back in stock, she would NOT do it.

First three orders, they delivered the order to my old address which I called ALL of the three times afterwards to ask them to update it (apparently they never did) I had to get a refund and still go grocery shopping the next day. I decided to do pick-up instead...I really can’t tell you what is worse. The Publix in Apopka, FL has been HORRIBLE, between problems with the app and whatnot, every time I had to get out of my car and go in the store to pick it up which is no problem at all if only I was told to do this instead of letting me wait in my car for 20 minutes until I have no choice. I have been getting pick up for the past year and a half at Apopka, I check out today and it turns out the app changed the Publix location to go pick up my groceries at to Longwood, FL, “just because” —it was not even something I specifically chose! So I get to the regular, already bad enough Publix in Apopka just to realize the app checked me out somewhere else! Horrible experience overall. Do not recommend. Deleting the app today. Not using it ever again!!!"

This last time tonight 12/3/2020 they assigned a driver to a store over 20 min away in another city and they  told her that they informed me. They just said it was going to be late not that they gave the wrong delivery person in another city no where close to the correct store. That was my straw that broke the camel's back. I cancelled the order and now I have to go to the store after work. I cancelled the membership it has been more of a hassel than what it worth.

They were unable to find many items (eg celery) and substituted many others with more expensive items. My shopper replaced a 12ib turkey with a 22lb turkey without asking me. When I noticed it and told her it was too large and I don’t want anything larger than 15lbs, she indicated she would not include it. She didn’t include it but still charged me $50 for it on the order. In trying to get a refund, one agent responded they were sorry I wasn’t available to receive my order and then asked when I would be available for redelivery. I responded tgst I wanted a refund and the next agent asked if I wanted a refund or credit to my Instacart account. Again I indicated I wanted a refund. The next agent I was directed to told me they understood my frustration but they couldn’t give me a refund because the order was more than 90 days old. After all the back and forth, it’s now a week old but clearly not 90 days old. This isn’t my first issue with Instacart. There hasn’t been a single order where they found the majority of items on my order often unable to find staples like bread despite the fact that there must be many acceptable substitutes. My experience with customer service has been horrendous."

This service was good when we started using it, but boy, has it gone downhill. We needed some clear nail polish to put on our key fobs to keep the number from fading off. The guy who delivered said he couldn't find it and didn't bother to ask if I wanted a replacement. This was from Walmart. Do I believe Walmart had NO clear nail polish, no. I complained about this and magically, the next delivery person when I ordered again found it. Today was the worst. I ordered paper towel and toilet paper for our office along with our regular cream and splenda and she didn't bother to deliver them. We still got charged. I also leave instructions for the person to come to the side of the building at the office door so we can hear them buzz. She went in the lobby and had to get a tenant to let her in. She set the stuff down and knocked so softly we couldn't hear her. (We saw this later on our camera system.) But we also saw she never did bring in the paper products. What a pain. Now I have to pay another of their ridiculous delivery fees to order the items again! I'll just order through Walmart and go pick it up myself in the pickup area. Not using Instacart again. Beyond the problems today, they had double-billed us and argued with me when I showed them the charge. Finally, it was taken off, but the customer service and 'convenience' as you can see, is missing to justify the payment of fees, heavy item fees for water, and tips. Done."

When I emailed them their response, both times, did not address the specified issue at all.

I've tried using them 3 times, and each time has been a disaster. This most recent time, I ordered a 12-14 pound turkey, which Kroger has on sale for $5.55. This was the primary item I wanted. I added  about 10 other items to my cart. I specified ""no substitutions"". I paid $12.48 in surcharges for delivery. I got 2 text messages saying Kroger was out of stock on a soup and garlic I ordered. And then the order was dropped off (late). My turkey was out of stock.  The shopper substituted a $35, 25 pound turkey for the $5.55 turkey. They substituted dry roasted sunflower seeds for a can of soup. I WAS SO MAD!!! I tried calling Kroger. They said to call Instacart. I called and spent 45 minutes on hold and was eventually told they would credit me the $30 difference between the two turkeys.....but on a future order. I agreed, but then discovered  I will still have to pay a surcharge for picking up an order. The bottom line is, swapping a 25 pound, $35  turkey for one that is $5.55 is BAIT & SWITCH. Kroger still has the $5.55 turkey listed on their website! I know darn well that they are not many families that want a huge turkey for Thanksgiving this year. I believe the sale price turkey is featured on Instacart so they can scam people into (instead) buying the big turkeys that Kroger is having a hard time selling. And how about substitution of dry roasted sunflower seeds for a can of spanish rice soup? Does that make ANY sense at all??"

I even went to the store and got a detailed receipt that showed the store received the correct amount of money for the smaller item-but my credit card was charged incorrectly.  There is no way to get in direct contact with them-the store manager told me of the ""ins and outs"" of how they have to deal with them and he didn't have anything positive to say.  I brought the smaller tub of butter and asked if I could exchange it right there but because of the rules with Instacart, he wouldn't let me.  I had my emailed receipt to prove I had been charged for the larger one, but to no avail.So, the only thing I would suggest is doing a full inventory with the shopper when they deliver-and if there is a mistake, you can try and work with that individual, hoping they will do the right thing.

It’s all on them and they should fix things before they are just a memory of generating a great biz idea they couldn’t execute with integrity. When Instacart first started, I jumped on it as I’m a busy woman and the local grocery stores have long lines and super crowded, so for me, it was worth the extra $$ to save precious time to be at home with the family.  That was just over a year ago.I did encounter a few problems, but the good outweighed the bad as long as I didn’t have to call customer service. Their customer service is the absolute worst ever!!!!  99% of them can speak just a little English, but cannot comprehend complex issues in English which just infuriates me to no end.  When you ask for someone in a leadership role or to be connected to someone in the US, they say NO quite rudely or hang up on you.  But again, I put this aside because of the convenience and 4 out of 5 orders being right was worth it...Until my subscription ended and I renewed for another year.They pushed me to renew but they didn’t disclose that on top of the $99 membership fee AND their price gouging (50 cents to $2 more per item) they added an additional varying fee to each delivery.  The whole idea of getting the membership was to avoid fees.  When I contacted them, some rude lady said I couldn’t cancel and get my $99 back and that the additional fees were to“Support the Instacart platform”So, a 17 BILLION dollar company needs to squeeze more fees from us to support their platform while cheating their shoppers/drivers because most customers take that fee from the tip.  Not only that, but 5 out of 5 of my latest orders were filled wrong or sent to shopper at the store’s other location 20 miles away that don’t carry the items on the website and therefore cancelled.  The website is always  wrong now. So what about that fee to support the platform??  Instacart is seriously going down the tubes...sewage tubes. Many stores are now kicking Instacart out and developing their own delivery service eliminating Instacart, saving money, giving us Customers better prices and hiring the same local GOOD shoppers/drivers but passing on the shady ones who dump your groceries at someone else’s unit, leave them next to the trash or pretend they cant find your apartment so you have to come down and get the groceries yourself....yes this has happened many, many times.  I’m DONE with Instacart.So people beware!  Call your grocery stores corporate offices and tell them how much Instacart SUCKS and beg them to develop their own shoppers/drivers.  Sprouts and a couple other stores have already dumped Instacart and I hope many more will follow suit and hire their own drivers."

So far, it's been an okay experience. Why I stuck to using it for this long is because I work 2 jobs. You do get stuck with some unprofessional shoppers who do a sloppy job at handling your groceries and not being careful with the fragile items (ex: eggs and bread). I wish there was a quick option where you can avoid a shopper you don't want for future orders. The only way you can do that is to call instacart's customer service to have them block that shopper directly. I dislike the tip system, how it automatically gives the shopper 5% of the total amount of your final purchase. Especially since you don't know if that shopper will handle your groceries with care. I believe they should have that option AFTER they are done delivering the groceries. Now, why I have decided to stop using instacart for good: The last purchase I made, the shopper had already paid for the groceries. But I noticed that at the very bottom of the grocery list, there was an item added to my card that said ""error"". It showed an amount of x2 for $75. So I was also being charged for this ""error"" along with my groceries. As I was trying to figure out why it was on the list, I received a text message stating that my order was rescheduled for the next day at 6:30 am, even though the website was already telling me that the shopper was in transit to bring me the groceries.I called the instacart customer service because I checked my bank to see that I had been charged for the original amount of my purchase of $150, on top of the $180 that I believe is from the ""error"", even though they rescheduled my order. The lady told me that there was an outage in the store. Which didn't make sense to me because the shopper didn't have any problem checking out and charging my card. She was already on her way to dropping off the groceries. It took customer service a while to really figure out what the problem was. I didn't feel comfortable with how the situation was handled, because all I was told was that she was going to leave a note for the next day that the order was going to be shopped, for the extra amount that I was charged (the ""error"" of $180) to be refunded to me. I told her I want to cancel my order and I also want to leave a bad review and block the shopper in charge of my order. The shopper never notified me about any 'outage' in the store, nor did she notify me that she won't be able to deliver the groceries. She also failed to mention anything about the ""error"" charge of x2 $75. There was no communication between the shopper and myself. By the time I wanted to contact her to see what was going on, the order had been rescheduled to the next day, and I had no way of contacting her.I did get my refund, but that was before I was charged from instacart for 3 separate payments. I still don't understand how it happened, but I was charged $150 for my original order, $180 for no reason apparently, and then another $150 the next day when the order has been cancelled. It seems that there was a mistake, and they assumed that I was still going to carry out my order.Because of this incident, I had to go without a week of food. I had to wait for the money to transfer back to my bank. My family ended up having to eat at my mom's in the meantime.Long story short, that is one of the worst experiences I had with instacart. I will not be using this app or any other online shopping site from now on."

I only use it to get food delivered for my grandma and the delivery people that deliver the food to her are sometimes rude and have no people skills. Secondly there was this kid that said he delivered my grandmas food to her but never did and just ran off with all of her food she paid for! Then this lady that delivered her food said she found all the items but when my grandma received her food she was missing hamburger meat and chicken breasts that she had paid for! The delivery lady was name ljahnay. And today this other lady named Tiffany that delivered her groceries picked out a 16.99$ 4lb hot dog pack and we had on the list 13oz 4.79 so if they were out of this brand she could’ve gotten something smaller or different brand not no 4lbs for my grandma that lives by herself and on a strict income. Who does that?! That’s the worst substitute you can ever make going from a 13oz to 4lbs is a big difference and price. So don’t ever get your food delivered from here they suck at picking good people to deliver food for other people. Never again will I use them for my grandma!

The first time I ordered through Instacart $70+ and the order was seamless at Publix. Great shopper and I received everything from Publix without a hitch. Today...garbage!  I ordered 11 things and everything had to be changed out with the shopper who this wasn’t his fault. Publix had nearly nothing I paid for and ordered. Items were replaced with other name brands, smaller sizes and much more expensive. Hell, I was swapped a piece of Salmon the size of a playing card for $7!  I contacted the store manager at Publix and he told me items jump off the shelves and I received best matches of what remained. $55 was the original cost of my 11 items that ended up being over $70. Recommend Instacart update their site as items deplete shelves or what is truly available at these stores as this is not a Publix error. I will not use Instacart, again.

Darin tried to explain to me that it's not his fault that he was running behind but that has car was having problems and continued to cut off or something to that manner. I tried to understand and calmed down only for Darin to start yelling at me that his navigation took him to the wrong building, claiming that that was not his fault either.

However, nothing was adjusted. So I called to inquire today and request a refund on the difference. I was told that is ""normal"" and that I would receive a ""one-time courtesy refund"" for the difference. I had to know more because if charging an additional $14 (on top of the 5.67 service fee and tip) is normal practice then I don't want to use this service in the future. Well the man I chatted with, Darrel Jason, proceeded to chat in a very condescending and unsupportive manner using all caps and making me feel like I was an idiot for not understanding this ridiculous policy. I eventually called into the company and spoke with a nice women. Again I was told this was policy but she actually handled the call professionally and never made me feel inferior. Basically, the company doesn't charge you what they actually pay for the groceries, you pay the estimated price you see online. Therefore you can order a chicken for $8 but only get a $4 chicken but still pay $8!!! Just awful. I think it's time to review your business plan policies."

I ordered it and was at my door step within an hour and the person who delivered it made sure they messaged me saying it was there with a photo and was overall extremely nice and pleasant. After that is when the personal shoppers started to get worse, they weren’t all terrible, but every time I ordered my orders started taking longer and kept getting delayed. Then the last person who made me get rid of this app was driving around in circles around the complex (not in it, but the neighborhood around it) took her two hours to get my order purchased, then about another 30 minutes to try and find my apartment that she was driving past the whole time. I’m not sure if it was her GPS or because she’s doesn’t know this area, but when we were chatting she seemed not very nice and was blaming me essentially and thought I put in the wrong address. It was not the wrong address, she just had a lot of issues; every other personal shopper never once had an issue finding my apartment in the slightest (I've ordered for a total around 5 times). I was so impressed with the first employee I thought I came across my new favorite app, sadly it’s mostly just a bunch of high school and college kids not really caring about giving at least decent customer service (this is coming from a recently prior college kid myself who have also hated my customer service jobs, yet tried to give great service because it’s not the customer’s fault you hate your job, except for the rude ones of course).

Before that, Instacart promised in writing that I would have a $35 credit on my account, but today started out with that credit NOT showing on my account! Then, after instant chatting and talking on the phone with several fraudulent, inflammatory, infuriating, scamming Instacart support team members, they lied about blocking my Instacart.com access to adjust tip (even though they stated that I had to adjust it on my end!), as well as blocking my instacart.com access to the star rating (they actually put 5-stars without my approval and without me doing it!), and also, blocked instacart.com access to being able to even report the problems and issues at all through their website! I had to end up filing a police report against the delivery shopper as well as the Instacart support team!!! Not to mention all the hours of agonizing stress all day and night long, literally trying to work this out with inflammatory, combative, infuriating, taunting, teasing Instacart support team!!! They actually didn't unblock my access in the 3 ways mentioned above and actually blamed it on my phone, app, browser, their website issues, etc! And, keep in mind that I NEVER even usied my phone at all NOR app, and even tried 2 different browsers!

And they haven't fixed the 3 ways they blocked my Instacart website access either! Also, the shopper claimed there was no brown rice that I asked for, and after wasting a lot of time and me not believing her, magically she was able to find the brown rice!

Also, eventually put back the promised $35 refund that was promised way even before today from another past scandalous issue, but not there originally at the starting of today. They have also fixed the star rating. However, they are still blocking MY personal website access to tip adjustment, star rating, and ability to report any problems or issues, and instead, they are choosing to be non-accountable!! Also, very traumatizing, tormenting, infuriating, and inflammatory at every turn and every with phone conversations and instant chat all-day and all night today!) Also, several Instacart support team members put on a one-month free trial membership on my account AGAINST my wishes; however, they swear that they didn't include automatic renewal, and swear that I will not be charged after the one-month free trial membership expiration! Several members REFUSED to totally remove the free trial membership AGAINST my wishes!!!!!The very next day after writing this review (above), I found out that they never deducted my tip from the total showing on my debit card through online banking, although they promised it just yesterday! Then, on top of everything else, they have now additionally blocked my website access to be to do instant chat with any of their Instacart support team members and also the phone number missing that I called them on just yesterday! The only thing showing was a phone number for senior citizens, which I am not a senior citizen, which was offensive and insultive! The only way I could reach them today was by the phone number I still had programmed in my phone from yesterday! Then, even though they refunded me the stolen amount from the personal shopper yesterday, now today, not only did I have to call to have them take the tip off of the total amount showing on online banking, but now told I have to wait 5-10 business days! On top of the entire fiasco already described above yesterday, now I had all this today, and on top of all that, they actually had a rooster sound going off constantly in the background, for further aggravation!nstacart has now also stolen from me! The receipt doesn't show my partial payment for what little fruit and chicken I did pay for, even though some was stolen. They used my $35 credit they gave me previously to that."

When there’s an unavailable item and have no choice but to refund the item money back to the customer, they can get a little upset and give me a 4 out of stars which isn’t terrible. However thanks to the rating system, even if your overall rating is a 9/10 they leave you with the worst batches dozens of miles away meanwhile the new shoppers gets the best batches since their rating is considered a 10/10 even though they never delivered or been rated. That’s why alot of batches been stolen lately or the orders been delivered late. Goodjob instacart, you failed for not caring about your experienced shoppers.

Instacart charged me $52 and change for just the groceries and then added delivery fee, service fee, sales tax and tip of course. The delivery fee and tip is expected but why am I paying sales tax on my groceries twice? Why am I paying delivery fee and service fee? Why is the total for my groceries more than what was paid in the store? When I reached out to customer service and asked these questions, all they said was “some merchants choose to make the Instacart price more than in store prices”. Oh ok so Instacart not only makes money off the service fees but also in the difference of what they actually pay when they shop for me and what they decide to show prices for on the Instacart app!? How is this ok? So I paid $18 more just to have my groceries delivered to me rather than go to the store myself. That was my dumb mistake. Not to mention the shopper did not even get all my items.

I placed a $975 grocery order with Publix which said it would be delivered within five hours. I spent approximately two hours placing the order and then another seven hours going back-and-forth with someone who was texting me about items that were out of stock and substitution options avail which I appreciate the fact that they were notifying me of what items were out of stock however it would’ve been much faster for me to go to the store myself. I literally Wasted my entire first day of vacation with my 12 best friends dealing with this order. Then the items were delivered to our vacation rental without any type of notification two hours later than they were supposed to be delivered and left on the hot porch in the 96° Florida sun and most of the items went bad on top of the fact that the meat they delivered us was either already expired or about to expire that day or the next day. They delivered chicken that was green and corn that was rotten etc. Many items were left off of our order Including steaks, they sent the wrong solo cups, they omitted sugar for my order and substituted ground chicken for ground turkey without asking and sent us two jars of spaghetti sauce instead of the four that we had ordered and so many other things. I contacted them immediately and their solution was to deliver the missing items to us the next day by 10 AM. If I needed the items the next day I would’ve placed an order for that day. This ruined our plans for cooking dinner for the evening. Then the next day the order that was supposed to be delivered at 10 AM got changed to 11 AM and then I got a text message that they couldn’t deliver it until after 1 PM and I wasn’t going to sit at the house all day waiting for this order on my vacation. I spent over 30 minutes on the phone with customer service. they said that they only have one delivery person available in the area and that the only option was for them to come after 1 PM or for them to give me a partial credit on my account. I asked them to refund my account for the missing items and after much arguing and rudeness from the customer service agent they said they would but they never did and it has been 9 days. I asked to speak to a manager and they refused. They charged me a $44 delivery fee and $44 tip for a total of $88 and they refuse to refund that amount even though I had to spend two hours placing the order, seven hours back-and-forth texting regarding substitutions, an hour or so at least on the phone the next day dealing with this and then I had to spend two hours driving to the store in traffic and returning the rotten meat and then replace the items that were omitted or exchanging the wrong ones that were received. I could have saved myself a lot of time and money and gone to the store myself in the first place. Lesson learned. I will never ever use this service again! it was my first experience and it was a terrible one. This company is a complete waste of time and money. Do not deal with them."

For one, 6 out of the 20 items ordered were replaced with different products all of which were NOT comparable. The most bothersome was the order for turkey sausage was replaced with “italian sausage” made with pork. Another product was for chicken thighs which I requested the bulk pack that was significantly cheaper than buying the smaller packs, but was instead given two of the smaller packs and charged the higher price. Also requested a bulk pack of 6 peppers but it was replaced with only a 3 pack and charged the more costly price. The shopper/instacart also believes sweet potato wraps are comparable to wraps made with rice flour. Whatever, not as a big a deal as replacing turkey with pork. Organic chicken stock was also replaced with regular chicken stock and charged a higher price. The only replacement I was ok with was for corn tortillas. However, they also charged me a higher price than the one I had requested. Another problem was Wegmans also listed bags of cole slaw as 2 for $3.49 but was given only 1 for $3.49. That is either very deceptive selling/pricing or a glaring mistake that instacart makes impossible to have corrected. All these problems could be forgiven if the prices were fair. However, not only do they markup a significant portion to pay for “someone else shop”, but they also charge an additional service fee AND delivery fee AND additional tips for the delivery driver. The store receipt had a final price of $99 but my order total paid to instacart was $138. With a 40% markup, I expect my order to be correct with zero disappointment in the order I placed. Needless to say, I will not be using instacart again in the future unless significant improvements are made and all the problems are addressed.

Sometimes, shoppers will accept their last batch as ""severance pay"" The only ones left these days are the newbies and the truly desperate.IC has been very aggressive combining orders at a same store, producing batches that require much more work to keep things separated across between two or three separate orders.  Of course the pay is not much better than shopping a single order with similar item counts.  Unlike IC who get to pocket three sets of fees but pay the shopper only once.  Any halfway experienced shopper will ignore those batches.  What's worse, orders with good solid tips tend to be combined with ones that have $2 or no tip at all.Another thing is that IC often ""sells"" items that are just plain out of stock at the store.  No, I'm not going to track down a manager to find out if your favorite brand is there if the app shows me an approved substitute right there on the shelf.  Don't blame the shoppers for IC selling items the store doesn't have.

A substitute should not be a lower quality item or significantly less quantity, or much higher priced. Give me a DIFFERENT BRAND of ORGANIC lemon juice of the about the same size, then yeah it's acceptable, but not this. Some of us have health concerns and are willing to pay premium for good stuff. I get back to instacart within like 5 min of receiving it and ask for it to be picked up and returned, my money refunded. Intacart goes ahead and shorts me on the refund. And please don't give me bs about 'you should have read the Terms and Conditions'.

They were to deliver within 2 hours, but the shopper could not locate any of the items and I declined replacements. However, Instacart still tried to charge me a $3.99 delivery fee for not delivering anything as the order was cancelled in full. Trtying to communicate with these instacart people is like talking to a wall. I finally, after 1 hour, managed to get through to a somewhat lucid person who said they had no way of reversing a delivery fee, regardless of non delivery. Ridiculous yes. It wasn't until I told them I would never use their service again and I did not want a 3.99 credit for a non delivery that they put me with a supervisor who supposedly credited my credit card back the full amount. We'll see and I'll report status later. But I highly recommend that your careful shopping through Instacart. Make sure you either OK replacements or cancel the order if nothing is available, otherwise you'll get charged a delivery fee for no delivery. I'd also be wary of the Shop N Save stores as they had NONE of my ordered items available, thus the cancellation of an entire order, 1 hour wasted ordering non existent items and another 1 1/2 hours dealing with people at instacart who do not communicate very well at all.

This order was worse than the last one. This order, Tracey evidently was not reading the comments with the items. She would substitute items without authorization. Example: (no substitutions allowed)Campbell Chunky Chicken Noodle Soup = Campbell Creamy Chicken n Dumplins Soup. (Now, how is a person lactose intolerant suppose to eat that?) Cranapple juice = Cranberry juice, Large oatmeal creme cookies = small oatmeal cookies. This is just 3 out of the 8 things substituted that were not authorized. Then to top it off, she left put my groceries on the porch on an 82 degree day and didn't tell me they were there. I discovered them when I decided to open the wood door at the beginning of my delivery time slot so I could see when she arrived. By the time I discovered the groceries, my ice cream was absolutely liquid, several of the frozen items were half thawed, the milk was cool to the touch, the fresh meat was ambient temperature. Five percent of my order was required to give as a tip (20.00). I have food I cannot use and food that was not able to be used because of damage with the heat and must replaced. The estimated cost of replacement, $85.00. I called Kroger to complain. They did not tell me instacart was responsible but gave me $30.00 on my card to help with replacement cost. I did find out instacart was doing the delivery when I called the Kroger location itself. I then called instacart to complain. The instacart representative said she could pass on my comments but was not very upset or seemingly surprised by my telling of the tale how my groceries were damaged. Here's the jab. I have a compromised immune system thereby prompting me to use delivery instead of going to the store myself. I am also on a fixed income and do not own a car. Had I known the exceptional service I receive at Kroger's Clicklist was not going to transfer to delivery and I would have to spend extra time and money to donate food I can't use and buy again, I would NEVER have used Kroger delivery.

I thought she was done but then when I looked back at my app it said that a different shopper had finished and was delivering it. I thought no big deal until after it was delivered and I saw that more than half of my order was missing. I immediately messaged the shopper and asked if she had possibly forgotten to leave the rest but heard nothing. Then I reported a problem but only received an email saying they got my report. After much digging I finally found a number to call but the person who helped me obviously did not care in the slightest. She said that she saw my report and asked if I would like to be refunded to which I said ""Yes."" She then asked if there was anything else she could do. I told her that I was not going to use Instacart anymore if it meant that I would just have to go to the store myself (after virtually shopping and messaging shoppers and waiting around for my delayed order). She said ""ok"" and ""have a nice day."" Instacart seems to not give a crap about their customers, has poor customer service and in my opinion is most certainly not worth the extra money, time or energy. I will be telling everyone I know how terrible their ""service"" is."

I tried asking through the app to pick a different kind as I needed some items for recipes or I might as well cancel the other items on the list. Her reply: “Nope.” And “Nope” again... when I got my groceries it was like she was having a really bad day as items were smashed, raspberry juice from a crushed container stained my entry rug, smashed bananas and chips. I could go on. I’ve ordered groceries online for 10+ years and it’s clear the sh!tty packing in this incident could not be an accident. I ranked the service bad in the app and the automated responses are like salt in the wound. Wanting photos 3 days later? Keep the $ and reimburse me for the fee. I don’t want Instacart to get any $. The absolute worst experience ever... I wish I could tip for pick up because they are not incentivized to do a good job and it might fix the situation...

It’s unsafe to shop in public even if I had the free time to, so we’ve had to depend on Instacart to keep my family safer.First off, the customer service is deplorable. If you report a problem, you don't get a reply for days, but they have no problem sending ‘bot mail’ to rate the missing reply...which ends up being a dead end. There are significant systemic issues with communication and order accuracy that are unrelated to out of stock items.It’s been 2 weeks since the last issue with no resolution or refund for over $100 in spoiled food due to errors with delivery timing and location which were clearly stated when the orders were placed.Problem # 1 is you can’t get a real person: you have to go through a maze I’d dead end faq’s and chat bots that don’t address the issue and take longer than the ordering process to navigate.  Then you get to an actual email address...or you can wait on the phone till you have to hang up and get back to life.Email provides a trail, but each exchange is with a different rep who keeps asking for details already provided earlier in the same thread...when they already have electronic access.  In other words, they’re asking us to do their jobs for them.I sent an itemized dated, chronological accounting of the ruined items for 2 orders yet they continue to ask me to repeat the same info. Asking for a supervisor is also useless.In short:  they don’t care, and once they have your money, it’s gone, unless you report it to your bank/card provider and add on that battle.Instacart needs a lot of work to....work well.  The app also freezes and lacks details the website has, there are time delays in communication we have no control over, I have no idea what the shopper sees, but I do know my timeframe and delivery info works on my end.  Using Instacart is also costly. Here are some other FYI’s including fees and tips: You pay to join, for any upgrades, and there's another fee applied to each order. They add on a minescule shop/delivery tip automatically with the option for an increase up front (to enlist better service?). I tipped 20% in advance hoping for that with plans to tip more for great service and I still got bad service.  If you wait till after the delivery to tip more are you more likely you get bad service?  I do know you don't get refunds on tips...or anything else, so basically you're at the mercy of whoever gets your order (an Uber-like system...which is about quantity rather than quality with the “tip in advance” system).There have been significant issues with delivery timing and orders being left in the wrong place in full sun, hours before delivery in 90 degree heat resulting in ruined and unsafe perishables, and weeks later, no resolution or refund despite numerous tries.It takes just as long (or longer) to place the order with Instacart as it does to do the shopping yourself.  They offer choices of delivery times that are ignored, so you will need to place the order and wait at home until it is delivered or they will leave it at the door in the blazing sun in 80+ degree heat whenever it suits them. That means if you place the order at 8 AM for your dinner ingredients to arrive at 5 PM after all of your Drs appointments so nothing spoils, it won't happen that way, you will need to throw away said items, and you will NOT be reimbursed.  So, you will need to budget for the loss...if you can afford to.Each of those botched orders has resulted in $75 of unreimbursed tips, fees, and food we had to discard.  Can you afford that?The accuracy of your order is dependent upon the shopper/delivery person and available stock, so you'd better hope you get a someone pats attention and cares or you will get whatever they feel like making the effort for.  We need organic items due to fragile health. I tip at least 29% in advance for the added effort.  There have been many unauthorized subs we cannot eat, and in addition to the above issues we've also received part of other people's orders in error.There has not been a single order that has been 100% accurate regardless of the day of the week or time of day, the amount of the tip, and communication about substitutions are dependent on the integrity level of the shopper and whether the app is working properly or crashes.Its' way too much $$$ - After the math is done, ASIDE FROM FEES AND TIPS using Instacart has been a 50% more than shopping ourselves (plus the time to place the order), which is way too expensive for my family. I wish there were a better cempetitor.  At this point, I am going to pay a neighbor to help us. At least I will know what I'm getting, if they are healthy, and it will just be one fee."

I also enrolled in their ""Free Delivery trial"". It gives you free delivery for 14 days, at which time you can cancel or continue with a subscription. My final tally (including free delivery) with tax was $261 and change. They list it as ""item total"" and then the tip I added on. That is the entire tally--just the 2 lines for Item Total and Tip. The item total perfectly matched the total on the printed receipt the store gave to the shopper (which I have in my possession) .  All the other surcharges, delivery fees were waived, and not even listed as line items for this order on the Instacart website.. I checked on the total 2 minutes later, and the bill jumped $30 ! It said the same exact format as the prior (correct) tally:  ""Item total"" plus tip, delivery waived. Somehow, their system jumped the total by $30, which was an obvious system issue on their part. When I contacted them, the pop up says ""An agent will contact you shortly"". Well, they don't !!

When I checked my phone at noon this last time the shopper had shopped the order at 10 IN THE MORNING--3 HOURS before it was to be delivered. Despite the fact I ordered no fat refried beans, they were replaced with traditional refried beans with lard, which I can't eat. The shopper repeatedly ignored texts and chats from me to get the correct item in the hour before it was to be delivered, and did the same when Instacart support tried to contact her. Worst of all, to get refried beans that I could eat, the company was trying to make me place ANOTHER ORDER WITH A $35 minimum--which is too pricy for three cans of beans. I was on the phone with support for hours listening to their lies about why the shopper wouldn't get the right item, getting hung up on by two of their agents, etc. I finally got someone to agree to a redelivery the next day. And what happened again? The shopper selected the beans with lard in it. Even worse, this order was to be delivered from 3-5 p.m. and I got a text shortly after 12 p.m. saying the shopping began. Before I could get my laptop going to check the shopper's progress, there was another text 1 MINUTE LATER STATING HE WAS CHECKING OUT and the order couldn't be replaced. I'm convinced Instacart had him get the wrong item on purpose and leave me no time to react  just to spite me for the previous day.

First off, we should not have to rely solely on tips to make our money since the customers can take their tips back; it would turn a $30 order to actually getting $11, and for working about 2 hours, that's so not worth it. Also the app would be great if we could call customer service and it didn't take forever for them to reply, and if the app didn't constantly freeze and malfunction during orders. This app is really only good when nothing goes wrong, the stores are all stocked up, and you don't have to wait on the customer to review items for replacing, but 80% of the time it isn't a smooth trip, so it's not worth having the app. I really wanted to like this app but it's failed me so many times that it's not worth all the stress and tears that have happened over things that should be simple fixes. The company isn't professional and they low ball all the time on orders, such as getting $7-15 for a big trip. Here are some examples I've had dealing with this company,One order I had, the customer wanted to add two more of an item she already had, the app wouldn't let me do it, so after 30 minutes of messaging with customer service they finally let me add it. Another time I went and the customer wanted to cancel the order, since the main thing they wanted was out of stock, and that took so long and was such a hassle to deal with with the customer service, they ended up reimbursing me $7 for the time wasted there, but that wasn't even worth it and was half the amount the app initially said I would get. Another time I went to costco for 2 orders and the membership numbers wouldn't pop up at checkout (which is what you need to pay) and again I was stuck waiting for customer service to message me after 30 minutes of standing near the cashiers like a freak, and finally they gave me a number that wasn't even the member number so I had no way of finishing the order, and since then I've talked to SO many different customer service reps about it, who are all clueless since the chats delete right away, and now they are threatening my account saying it was MY fault that the app didn't work.There are many more examples but I can't think of them on the top of my head, for how little you get paid, and how much BS you go through please don't get this app, because you will be going through the same sorts of experiences sooner than later. I'm going to apply for Shipt until I can find a real job again because I can't go through this anymore."

Line was answered by a gentleman who could barley speak English but I worked with him as he attempted to contact the shopper/runner.  We were unable to do so for over 30 minutes and then he told me I would have to go inside the store and ask for the items.  Kinda defeats the purpose so I made him try again and then they bring out the groceries, I drive home and discover that out of the 80 dollar order I had 9 dollars worth, they had skipped both the meat and seafood.  I then contact InstaCart back and they then proceed to tell me that they cannot get a hold of the shopper/runner and did I want a credit or a refund the refund which would have placed the money back in my account after a 4 to 5 day hold for product they did not give me.  This was for my wife's birthday dinner so I told them that we wanted what we were charged for.  They then contacted the store and told us that a bag had been left out and could I come back. That is what I did and after a small wait in the parking lot they brought it out.  The real problem with this is not the complete lack of a decent experience but rather that through this process I was lied to more than 3 times, ""It was a paging glitch"", ""It was a shift change"".

They also disregarded a specific request in a note we added BEFORE she began shopping, requesting that a boneless dinner ham NOT be sliced. She replied ""Okay"", but delivered a different brand and it was SLICED. We always tip $10,so my wife gave her the money without checking the order. She also made mistakes on 4 other items. I drove to the grocer and found all the items she'd replaced or claimed were unavailable - - immediately after her delivery! Also, the grocer won't take anything back, and you have no receipt.

I ordered 3 bottles of Jim Beam Maple which is very hard to find and typically sells for $16 to $20 each. Instacart had it at $17 so I ordered 3 bottles. I checked their policy for alcohol delivery which states the delivery person must check the ID & insure the buyer is of age and not intoxicated before physically transferring the alcohol to the buyer.Two hours later the Instacart delivery driver ran up my stairs dropped 3 bottles of the wrong alcohol (Jim Beam Straight Bourbon) which is easy to find and $10/bottle.After the driver ran away I retrieved the package finding they delivered the wrong product. I immediately called customer service to get the correct product exchanged for the one that was delivered or refund my purchase. I was told I cannot return products during COVID19 after delivery has been accepted. I sent them my security video showing their driver never tried to get me to accept delivery of alcohol (which is illegal in CA). They would not refund the $48.75 or deliver the product I actually ordered. They only offered a credit to my account minus the delivery charge and expected me to accept the wrong product. I felt like I wanted to go to Instacart Headquarters in San Jose so I could shove the 3 bottles up the asses of the 3 top people who run Instacart but realized it would not be worth going to jail over this company that has no problem with breaking the law as well as the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced.So, in summary, Instacart expects customers to place orders for products they may or may not deliver but will issue no refunds, take no returns or attempt the correct product so customers should pay for products they did not order.I finally contacted my credit card company tied to Instacart, giving them the evidence of the illegal alcohol delivery and the wrong product, putting Instacart in breach of contract. The credit card company refunded the Instacart charge. Instacart then cancelled my account. I WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH INSTACART EVER ! ! !"

But Instacart will still charge you for that large size even though you only received the smaller size.  It's a nightmare trying to fix mistakes."

She refunded my money and cancelled my account that was set up through Publix, immediately as I requested.  However, my checkbook and budget is totally off from this withdrawal, in which now I now have to wait for 5 days to be refunded to my account which is causing me problems for my scheduled payments.  I am so not happy and disappointed; but, at least I get my money back. Also, they sent the money through immediately which is more upsetting. I will not be recommending this service to ANYONE and please, please read the contract.  I thought I did a thorough job of that, but, obviously, they just want your money.

I've relied on Instacart for all of my groceries and prepared meals because I don't cook, and my work schedule is crazy. The prices were higher, but the convenience was worth it until recently when their prices sky-rocked into ""price gouging' mode. Items that were a couple of dollars higher than the in-store pricing are now five dollars more than they were a few weeks ago. I once had the ability to select a preferred store location within a certain distance, and shoppers were able to choose which store they shopped at. Now they keep sending all of my shoppers exclusively   to the most poorly stocked and mismanaged store in the entire Publix chain (Sunshine Plaza). The prepared food selections are limited and the food is ALWAYS overcooked. Every time I buy Ice Cream it arrives melted, and looks like it has been refrozen more than once. I have repeatedly contacted CS to complain and request a different Publix location, but they say it is automated, and cannot be changed despite having several Publix stores within five miles of my home. Most are within three miles or less.I have had to place multiple orders on the same day and/or following day to complete my shopping because I rarely receive half my order. I am starting to think this failure is by design since the  minimum purchase amount of $35 per order regardless of whether it is due to missing, wrong, or damaged items. The dollar amount of what's missing is usually around $20, so I have to pad my next order with things i don't really need at the moment. That's some racket they've got going.Yesterday I discovered SHIPT, and I am thrilled with their service. Prices are about the same, and they go to the stores that have the items on my list, My shopper even called some of the stores ahead of time to make sure they were stocked on my regular items and special request.

Didn’t receive Motrin even though I got charged, was given cherry coke when I ordered regular, sugar was out so without even asking and specifying that if it wasn’t available I didn’t want a substitute they gave me a huge bag of sugar substitute, ordered paper plates that were 10 inches wide and when those were out they decided that plates that could barely hold a price of cake were okay to get instead, it was a $200 grocery order and I basically had to go out all over again and pay for everything again. It was a complete mess when I filed a complaint and said for them to contact me to discuss they never did but did refund the cherry coke which totaled .99 cents.

It took an hour on hold with Costco and Instacart and they said the receipt from Costco isn’t the real price (although it’s an itemized receipt showing the price of East item.

A single star review now seems too generous. Since they have returned to deliveries on the same day since COVID-19, the service has been markedly so terrible that I am posting here after giving them three tries: (1) The first Instacart person delivered frozen food that was lukewarm at best and mushy ice cream, all the produce was thrown haphazardly in bags, and of course, missing items (could be the delivery person, could be the store). (2) The second Instacart person emailed (timestamped) us that we would soon get our delivery but then we never got it (we were watching and have Ring), so I called and complained, then our neighbors discovered the items in bags melting on our driveway later that day, even though it was door delivery. (Was he avoiding the Ring time stamp?) The driver apparently also had a magic time reversal machine, as he send an email AFTER my complaint that he had delivered it BEFORE the complaint and 20 minutes before the time of his own, original email stating it was still on its way! Instacart did refund us on that one but they did not clean the stains on our driveway from the spoiled food. (3) This last Instacart person was acceptable in general service some ways, but was not wearing a mask (as per our Ring video), although the produce was now in bags (some were missing), but still less partially thawed frozen items and lots of missing items. Tip amounts don't seem to matter, as I've tried adding a large tip at the beginning OR keeping what the store suggests--neither made any difference in service quality. Instacart needs to train better so that there are shopper/packers and separate delivery persons who must use some kind of storage to keep the items cold and wear masks. The rating system should be public for each delivery person so that the excellent and good workers can fairly rise to the top so that they can be selected and tipped accordingly."

They overprice every product they sell and they justified implying that the different shop sites like Costco, bjs, Publix, etc platform are the ones who overcharge us. But the truth is that a few of the Instacart shoppers include your receipt with your shoppings and it’s way different the price it shows, it goes from $20-$50 or more the difference.  Why a receipt from the store even if they are the ones supposedly charging you more, have the same prices as if you go to the store so the difference it’s being taken by the owners of the app.  And even thought they “do not have control over this” (which is what they try to sell us) they do not do anything about it, like give you a credit for the extra charges. I think this is not fair. People like me, with a condition and two little kids on my own can not go shopping by myself in this times and decide to pay to be done. Owners or creators of this app are selling the wrong message. Do not pay their membership. I can assure you it is not worthy. And on top of that they do not care about your situation or condition but the profit they are making at people’s expense. And by the way it is important to let you know that they DO NOT REFUND the membership  and after you  report an issue they disable the issue report at your account.

Items I ordered and had paid for were missing. (I was not contacted during the shopping process for notification that those items were out of stock and asked if I wanted a replacement or refund. This wasn’t the issue.) These items apparently were just missed during the shopping process.  Luckily, I noticed those items were missing and checked my receipt and saw that I was charged for them. I went to their website and clicked on the missing items, as prompted.  My ONLY options then were to receive a credit or get a refund. NO option to request that the remaining items on my order be completed and delivered.  I finally found a phone number that I called and got customer service people in South Africa who offered a host of excuse, but obviously can’t resolve errors made by Instacart.  All I wanted, was for them to fix THEIR error, request that my shopping order be completed and delivered.  They claimed they can’t do that.  I would have to place another $35 minimum order, if I wanted to get the missing items from my last order.  Although the error was theirs, they claimed they can’t waive the $35 minimum order, to provide a way of getting and delivering the rest of the items they had missed on my order. My complaint is not with the shopper, who most likely just overlooked some items. It’s with the company who doesn’t rectify errors.  I’m sure this happens on occasion, yet they have no solution in place to accommodate their customers when Instacart doesn’t process an order correctly. I’ve never encountered a company that wasn’t willing, nor have a process in place, to fix an error on their part and try to provide good service to their customers.  Although we’re still in a Pandemic, I’ll not use their services again because of their lack of accountability to their customers.  Mistakes happen; but having no way to fix the mistake is unacceptable.  It’s very disappointing, as it could be a good service, except they don’t stand behind their service."

You would think with people wanting to spend the least amount of time out of their homes with the virus that a service like InstaCart would be working better to assist people and also accepting multiple forms of payment as I know many got their stimulus on prepaid cards and there are also people out there on food stamps.

At checkout the company card (we use to pay for the customer purchases) declines when everything was correct on the order, and I have to pry chat support to get them to cancel, only to get an automated system not telling me how to fix the decline, but the company asking me if I can pay for it with my own money. I refused, and now am lost completely in how to continue with this company that does not train its employees. I was ""self trained"" by the faq's on their app, After reading these reviews from the customers, I can say its not just the suspected ""shopper stole them"" but also could be declines on the company card due to price inconsistencies, as well as giving incorrect adresses to the shopper, primarily wrong zip code. To note, I did not recieve any of the customers cash during this order after cancelling, so i'm unsure if most shoppers are actually pocketing groceries/money but from what I know now, Instacart steals from its customers by not returning their money back and also overcharging. As an employee there was no way to reach support either for any app issues or payment issues. Both shopper and customer are left it the dark in what's actually happening in these situations. I now don't want to continue for a company that doesn't refund the money to the customers. On the flip side the company even asks us to pay for the items ourselves if we experience company card issues, and I have heard mutiple reports of employees not being reimbursed as promised. Same just like the customer. I don't feel comfortable working for them anymore knowing so much can go wrong easily to make me look like a fake. We don't get paid enough for shopping, $7 base and own gas, so who knows what all shoppers are doing in actuality, but half of us are really trying to get the orders done and being failed by inconsistencies in the app. Blame it on the company pretty much!

I thought everything was going pretty good, occasional bad shopper but overall great service etc.  I was telling everyone about how great it was to be able to keep working (I work from home) and have someone else do all of my shopping.  Then, one day, I started comparing the prices of what I ordered vs. what the final bill was.  I understand (sort of) of price mark up on items.  They are a business trying to make money.  Stores do that themselves.  I get that.  Buy from one company, raise your prices, sell to someone else.  But when you get a receipt and it says $12.99 but you're charged $16.99, that's so not cool.  I have since learned that InstaCart has a rule that the shopper is not allowed to even give you the receipt.  I've specifically requested the receipts but very rarely get them.  This is why.  Every single time I get a receipt it is way less than what I have paid InstaCart.  They need to just be upfront and say they will charge an upgrade percentage on all items.  So if something says $6.99, they will charge, say, $7.69.  Be up front!!  Don't rip people off behind their backs.  That doesn't instill trust.  Right on your front page make it known that your prices are 10% higher (or whatever) than the stores price.  People will understand it is the price of convenience.  But don't tell them a price on something and then charge a higher price when you charge their credit card.I realize they've been in business for over 7 years or so.  But more and more people are experiencing their ripping people off tendencies as well as their horrid customer service where everything is someone else's fault not theirs at all.  Once this whole COVID-19 thing is over, I wonder how many people will actually linger on as customers.  They really need to change their practices and stop trying to rip their customers off if they want to stay in business and not get sued.But, the biggest, and most disturbing thing that has happened is discovering that they are charging way too much tax.  I recently was charged 75% tax on an order!  Customer Service claimed that there were items on the order that were taxable besides the one that actually was.  Everything else on my order was food!  I actually happened to have the receipt for that order and everything was marked F with only that one item marked Tx.  Calling Customer Service (Chat actually) is a joke.  They have canned answers that push the blame onto something else.  It's always something about prices being different or cities have different taxes and they charge the tax rate based on that city, etc.  So I push back, hard, and they finally admit that I'm right.  By the time I'm finished with them I've spent an hour trying to get it straightened out and the final resolution is a $5.00 credit.  Not what I was actually overcharged and not the hour's worth of my time.  But I pursued it out of principle.  The sad part is that they absolutely will not help you or admit fault unless you push back, hard.I'm getting very very tired of every order adding up wrong or having too much tax.  The California State Board of Equalization would frown heavily on this if they were made aware that InstaCart is charging more tax than on what is actually taxable!  I might have to call them.InstaCart is convenient and definitely helps during this pandemic.  But go into it with eyes wide open and know that you WILL be overcharged."

I reached out to Instacart customer service and after some back and forth, they finally told me that they include a markup on all items from most grocery stores. Each store has a policy, but it’s buried in the app - I think this information should be very, VERY upfront. I’m now cringing at all the times I’ve overspent on groceries without realizing it.

April 29th I ordered - only 10 things, no biggie.  Wasn't asking for toilet paper or any items that would likely be out of stock.  I had tipped $10, too, because I was just grateful to not have to go to the store.The shopper sent me alerts through the app saying that were out of this or that, but never really communicated.  So Target is COMPLETELY out of any gallon size zip lock storage bags?  Seems unlikely, but okay.  Next thing you know, I got an alert with a picture of my groceries on someone else's porch!  And once your items have been delivered the chat is disabled.  I immediately filed a report saying that my groceries were delivered to an unknown address.  Honestly, I would have been okay with the shopper going back to get them, and then bringing them to the correct address.  No such luck.I decided to track down a phone number and call.  You immediately get a response saying that the call volume is heavier than normal, and to expect long waits.  Imagine my surprise when someone answered within 2 minutes.  Firstly, it was a bit difficult to understand the customer service rep as English was not her first language, but whatever.  My problem was that she immediately tried to blame the issue on Target and suggested that I call them!  I challenged her and said that Target is merely a third party in this.  The problem is with INSTACART, not Target.  She backed down and said she would look into in further.Fifteen minutes later, and having been taken off and put back on hold no less than 10 times, Diana (customer service rep) said that I would have a refund within 5-10 business days.  Fair enough.That brings us to today (May 13).  It's been two weeks, and that refund is still not in my bank account.  The app says that I've been refunded, but the funds have not arrived.  So, again, I call Instacart.  I get the same message about heavy call volume blah blah blah, and yet, someone picks up almost immediately.  I explained to this customer service rep the situation, and he immediately tried to punt the ball and say it was an issue with my bank.  Again, I challenged that, and he relented and said he would look into it.  He came back after a few minutes and said that he was escalating my case and that I should have my refund today or tomorrow.What's interesting about this is that I figured out where my groceries were delivered.  The porch did not look like any of my neighbors, so that wasn't it.  There is a street name in my city that is similar to mine (Park vs. Parkview), though it is in an entirely different zip code.  I looked it up on Google maps and what do you know?!  Same porch that was in the pic the shopper sent to me.  I didn't drive over there to ask for my groceries, because it had been hours and who knows how long the refrigerated items had been sitting out.  But I almost feel like Instacart should reward me for solving the mystery for their incompetent shopper.It is worth noting that this company seems to have a pattern when a mistake is made . . . they love to deflect and punt the ball.  They state that call volumes are ""high"" yet someone answers almost immediately.  And no matter what the issue is, it's someone else's fault.  Ultimately, they just want you to go away and not bother them.  Now fingers crossed that my refund will actually land in my bank account by tomorrow."

When I contacted Instacart, the first service representative immediately, before I even finished my first sentence explaining the situation, yelled in a very loud voice, ""There are no dog treats on your receipt! I WAS going to give you a refund, but not NOW!"" I hadn't given her any order information and as the conversation continued it seemed like she wasn't looking at my receipt at all. The situation escalated from there as she rattled off a host of weird excuses, including saying that I was seeing someone else's receipt ""mixed in"" with mine. I asked her how that was possible and she screamed, ""NO! NO DOG TREATS!

The second service rep noticed two items (vegetables) on his copy of the receipt which were not on mine; instead, there were two dog treats. I got neither the vegetables I was supposed to get nor the dog treats I was charged for. He kept saying his receipt didn't have dog treats so I wasn't charged for them, but I definitely was, and he absolutely refused to acknowledge what happened. He also started offering weird excuses, saying I ""wasn't supposed to get a paper receipt"" (I didn't get one, I have no idea what he's talking about) and also that ""one tomato is only $1.64,"" which didn't seem to have any bearing on the matter.

Dillon's was very helpful when I called them about what happened, but if they insist on using Instacart, I can't trust them. I very much recommend avoiding Instacart if at all possible. UPDATE: I received both a voice mail and an email from Instacart with an apology and a promise for $100 credit on their website for my trouble, but the credit never showed up, of course.

I’ve used Instacart several times during this Covid mess. But recently I started paying attention to the prices on my meat after I noticed this huge difference. The first couple times it happened I was refunded quickly. Suddenly I had to send pictures to prove what prices I saw on my meat package. Are there no honest companies out there? Is Instacart really that desperate to be raising prices and outrageously charging customer like me who have no other choice. At this rate I’d rather take my chances in the store than use their service. They are dishonest.

My instacart receipt looks VERY different from the store receipt (different items; different totals).  I'm owed lots of money for discrepancies and missing items. This terrible experience is despite a $5.99 shipping fee and $10 service charge (plus $9 tip... because I spent so much time with the shopper...even though he got the order severely wrong regardless of our texts).Tried to contact instacart through the app. Was told I'd get a response in 5 days.... which is entirely unsatisfactory.

What a TERRIBLE UNETHICAL company to try to work with. Just the fact that they have time to send out a letter like that but dont have time to look into my complaint of being overcharged is irresponsible.

I was charged for items I was not given and still until this day they have not refunded me. I have been trying to get refunded for 8 piece chicken and chicken tenders that I was not given on April 20,20.  I placed a curbside pickup order. I was given a brown paper bag with a receipt in it for the chicken I ordered. Total $32.46 $8.49 for 8 piece mixed chicken and 23.97 for chicken tenders. Beware they like to ignore your emails and then tell you its to late to get refunded because its been over a week. They ignore the fact that I contacted them on the same day I did not get my items and several times after. They also tell you they can substitute items and they show the same price as the orginially item you ordered but later you find out that they really charge you over twice the amount of the orginally item you ordered. If you need to place a pickup order walmart is the place to use. Beware of instacart. I guess I will have to go into the store to get my refund which defeats the purpose.

However, it is not always clear how much will get charged to your account and - more importantly - they will place a hold on your money even if an order wasn't actually placed.Just last week, I tried to place an order (around $120 in item costs) and had a $175 charge appear on my bank statement though *no order was actually placed*; I didn't receive any items and there was no record that I had been charged, except through my bank.  Fortunately, I had enough to cover the charge, but I can imagine many situations where this would cause an overdraft.  It took 6 days for this amount to be refunded to my account.(5) Customer service is terrible, basically nonexistentEvery time I have tried to contact customer service (except last week), I have just given up instead, because it is such a frustrating process.  While the rest of their website is gorgeous and well put together, the customer service parts seem like they were built in the early 90s - completely laughable.  The easiest way to get in touch seems to be through the barely functional chat box, though it still took me close to 2 hours last week to get an answer about why my account had been charged without an order.  The first time I got connected to an agent on the chat, they took so long between responses that the chat timed out and I had to restart the process.  I would never have imagined it would take 2 hours to have someone tell me 'Yeah, we don't know if there is an order or when the charge will be removed - probably around a week'.  It's like their system is built to be frustrating, to keep people from reaching out or asking questions.In general, it just seems like Instacart does not care about us as customers or as workers/shoppers - they only care about getting your coins and once they have them, everything else is up in the air.  Avoid this service unless you don't care how, when, or *if* you get the groceries you paid for."

During the 3 week wait time, Instacart put a hold of $105. on my card for what was then $70. worth of groceries.3.Frantically attempting to reach my shopper, Nicholas, finally got thru that I was not approving any of his substitutions--- like a huge container of peanut butter that was twice the cost of what I'd ordered, or Kosher Dill Pickles instead of Cornichons, because he didn't know what Cornichons were, so the actual charge ended up $55.4. He showed up in the lobby of my building, where my landlord was standing, wearing no mask or facial covering, disallowing him entrance--- $300. fine in this state for not wearing mask, BTW.So I had to meet him at a side door, exiting my apartment, walking up stairs ( I'm disabled) wearing a mask myself, and gloves ( high risk), opened door for this 22 year old irresponsible 12 year old, and he was holding plastic bags (  and on which COVID 19 can survive for 3 days) placed the bags on ground, which were exceptionally heavy for me to lift, but wanted no contact, which was the ENTIRE PURPOSE OF ORDERING FROM INSTACART. he told me ""I forgot my mask"".5.

Don't get me wrong, my shopper was excellent and no contact occurred and she communicated with me about anything she couldn't fill was to my house before frozen stuff wasn't any more.  But my order which was exactly the same as my last time physically shopping there, was almost twice what it would cost if I went myself.  Perfect example, two pork loins, 5 lbs total, marked clearly 2.99 a pound, $15.91, I was charged 7.99 a pound or $36.95 more than twice the cost, everything was really marked up, more than 25%, then there was the delivery fee and service fees of 8.50 fee if I remember 7.50.  Plus since it wasn't the shoppers fault the company screwed me, I still tipped her.  By all this my order cost more than twice what the actual cost would have been.  If some of that had been going to the shopper I wouldn't have felt so taken advantage of, she risked herself and I could never afford to tip enough for something like that, but I'm told the shoppers get a flat rate around minimum wage...   I called Instacart, was on hold more than two hours then auto disconnected.

Amazon, Target & Walmart would be in so much trouble if their website said something was in stock, charged your credit card, promised delivery of it and then text/email you to tell you it was unavailable and asks if you want a replacement/substitute. And they don’t even charge all these fees and try to sell you things at a higher price as compared to in store. All I can say is, if you have money to burn and don’t mind replacing/substituting everything you took the time to order AND spending even more time with customer service, chat or otherwise, which incidentally (or perhaps intentionally) disconnected me THREE times while the shopper was waiting for instructions at wegmans, THIS SERVICE IS FOR YOU!!!!!I canceled the ongoing order because I was unwilling to pay all their fees for a few measly items, tried to still give tip to shopper but was not given any help on how to do this (Castiemme S, if you’re reading this, I’m sorry you did not get anything for your efforts) and am waiting to see if my $105 put on hold by instacart will be posted as charged or unsuspended from “pending” (in other words, truly canceled without any fees). If I am charged for a delivery that was canceled, as evidenced by the text instacart sent me, I will take this up with the authorities."

I've used the service twice. My first Instacart order was last week and it was delivered with the Market Basket store receipt. The prices I was charged were actual store prices as I know them. Today's order came with no store receipt and was rife with up-charges. For example, a 6 count box of Bubba Burgers costs $11.99 in store. I called to confirm.  Instacart charged me $20.79, a whopping 74% mark-up!!  A single package of fresh mozzarella is around $4. It was replaced with two smaller packages (combined they were 33% smaller than one package at the regular size) and I was charged $9.79. That is over a 100% mark-up! And there were others. I called Instacart to complain but their customer service people talk in circles and babble about their pricing policy to the point where you just hang up and swear to never use them again. My advice is to risk whatever virus is out there and shop yourself. The aggravation alone from Instacart will give you a coronary. It's just not worth it!"

Due to my busy lifestyle and work schedule i was excited to find an app that i could have groceries delivered to my doorstep while i complete task at hand that i cannot do or having trouble finding time to do. My first impression was non satisfying. Three of my most important items were not delivered. My loaf of bread from the middle back was COMPLETELY smashed. I had someone else’s item as well. The time it took me to go out later that evening to get my items and getting on the app to figure out how to talk to someone about my issues was impossible and a huge waste of my time. No one reached out to me for the mistakes or even offered to have my missing items delivered to me. Instead i was just given a credit on my next order and the only reason i found that credit was because i was searching for a way to speak to someone. I had spoken by chat to someone before i had made the decision to give it a try (and have it saved) that the answer to my question said “Tip” did not mean an actually “Tip” to the shopper. It was a service charge in the “service fee” but the person i spoke with today (by the way, i had to get the number from my bank to call and speak with a representative, because no number or email to speak with anyone is listed in the settings.) told me today that the shopper was given a tip listed on the receipt. So the shopper got a $6.00 tip + the $5.00 tip i gave her. Horrible experience, waste of time, untrained shopper, and a lot of aggravation!  Would not recommend this service to anyone!"

Specifically, they charged me for 4.8 lbs of organic chicken tight at the organic price of 5.49 instead of the non organic price of 2.19 which i could see on the packaging of the conventional chicken thighs i received. Instead of charging me $16.45 which was the sticker price on the chicken, they charged me $41.23. The exact same thing happened to the turkey. Understanding mistakes happen, i reported the issue through the app, waited a few days and no response. Then i tried to call Instacart and they were not taking any calls.

Shoppers DO NOT listen to instructions. I specifically put to deliver to the blue doors and not the side door as our renter lives there and may think someone bought the groceries for him. It's not that he would steal them, it's that he may think someone ordered it for him and he'd take it. Only TWICE were the instructions followed.Then they charge you for the groceries but they're not included. One dumb shopper took a picture of what she delivered PROVING that she did not deliver all of the items, yet i was charged for them. My pre-authorization charge for one shopping was returned and correctly charged to the right amount. The other three are still there and they're saying, as I type this, that my bank will remove 24-48 hours. BS. The bank always removes it the same day and charges it correctly the same day BASED on what they are charging. This was the only time a pre-authorization charge remained and the amount that should be charged not charged. I understand pre-authorization charges can take time with some companies but that doesn't happen with THIS company.Out of 8 orders, 4 of them were fine, other 4 were terrible. How do you get it wrong 50% of the time? And I believe if I keep using them, the amount of screw ups from the dumb shoppers they have will increase. I am searching for another grocery delivery company that has the same choices as Instacart does. If Walmart didn't have half their crap as in store only, I'd dump this horrible company in a heartbeat.  I HATE this company. But they have a wide variety of stores to choose from so I'm stuck with this. I don't want to pay a yearly membership for BJs and Costco and I don't purchase all of the items there anyways.

The second order was a total disater and i wish that I were there! I am in the Ohio and my grandmother is 2 1/2 hours away in another state. Jennifer, the shopper, called me and left a message because I was not available insisting that I call her back. The order was to be delivered and showed a completed status on their app from the prior day. I paid 14.99 and for the delivery and service.  I alerted instacart of the situation via their channel to report a concern. I received a generic email about the situation.  When Jennifer showed up with the day late order to MY AGING RELATIVES HOME, she was insistant about a tip. My grandmother called me and was totally confused about what was going on so she gave Jennifer the phone.  Jennifer was insistent that I forgot or didn't know how to leave her a tip on the app and wanted to walk me through the process.  There was a back and forth exchange THAT WAS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!!!! Because the call was on speaker, I continued to hear the conversation after I thanked and disnissed her and she was rude and forceful!!!! If I had been there with my aging grandmother,  that behavior would not have happened.  Because I was not there, it was a DISASTER! I have tried to reach instacart several times today at their customer service nunber and only got a message that refers me back to the app where your CANNOT report about the shoppers behavior or a bad experience!!!!

Day 3 early morning my 94 year-old mother's shopper shopped, texted me (son) a few replacements, all seemed good, shopping done by 11 am. Delivery promised same day. Instacart app promised delivery that day. After waiting around all day the app changed in the early evening to promise delivery the next day. By end of Day 4 made inquiries, long interminable chats revealed no-one knew what was going on. Finally told me someone had to re-shop, somebody somewhere dropped the ball. What bugs me most is that two chat reps through Day 4 told me all OK, problem solved, delivery by 4pm. 5 pm chat tells me re-shopping necessary, couldn't give a delivery estimate. Forget it."

Doesn't even deserve 1 star","Worst experience ever. One star is being generous. The first time I ordered through Instacart, I ordered 2 days in advance. The day of delivery, I had 3 or 4 different shoppers.... after being delayed 5 hours, I asked the 3rd shopper ""are you going to be able to deliver by 5 pm."" she simply replied ""Cancel order."" in the chat box and stopped responding. So, I sat on hold with Customer Service for more than an hour, they reassigned it and gave a $20 credit. Great. They guy who delivered then was great, except he smoked in the car and my grocery bags smelled like smoke. I'm highly allergic. So fast forward a few weeks, I decide to give it another go and use my $20 credit. I ordered from 2 stores - Central Market and Costco. Central Market totaled around $125 before fees, Costco was $13. I receive a notice through the app my Central Mrkt order was being shopped, in 5 or 10 min I get another notice it was complete. I thought WOW they were fast. I looked at the receipt and noticed there were a ton of adjustments that the shopper never asked me about, increasing my order total. Shortly after I got a notice my Costco order was being shopped by a different shopper. I then noticed my Central Market was allegedly delivered....problem is, it wasn't. I was home all day and nothing. I drove up & down my street checking neighboring houses - nothing. I asked my Costco shopper if she had it. She said no. I got my 2 items from Costco. After a rabbit trail through the app, I finally was able to mark all items in the CM order as missing. I tried to call - Instacart isn't taking calls - my guess is because they're hammered with customer complaints. Couldn't access chat at all. I emailed customer support multiple times. Never received an answer. Three days later I finally gave it another go and was able to get into the Chat queue. Spoke with someone, told him the story, he refunded the CM items, but failed to reapply my $20 credit to my Costco order and left it on the CM order that was being refunded, so the refund is short by $20 bucks.... or they've retained their fees for a service they never performed. Just today my neighbor also ordered from them and had very similar problems. I am done with this service and will be speaking with my bank once the bill for CM clears. Ironically, the day I was supposed to have received my order and didn't, I went to the store myself. Shopped the exact same items, added a few additional things and stuff for my neighbors. My total was substantially less than through Instacart for more items. Don't waste your time or money on this service. It is a joke!!"

InstaCart lists the 'regular' prices for products but does NOT list sale prices or in-store specials.

Lambert,1 star: Bad,INSTACART IS WORSE THAN COVID19,"I believe that most of us can be a little flexible and patient during a pandemic but this company’s operations are flat out inexcusable, if not criminal.1. Paper towels were missing from my order so I clicked the button that said report a problem. I requested 56.98 refund. They deducted the 55.98 from my credit card. I was happy ! However, the next day they charged me 56.98 which basically canceled my entitled refund. I disputed the charge with Amex. However, their customer service line does not take calls and good luck getting any kind of replies to an email. If instacart is not accessible then, according to Amex, I win the dispute. I encourage everyone to put false charges in dispute.2. Due to the above activity on my credit card, initiated by Instacart , they sent me an email saying there was suspicious activity on my credit card and deactivated my account. They are the ones who created the suspicious activity. At the same time my account was deactivated I received an email from them requesting photos of my drivers license and the last four digits of my credit card. They wanted me to authenticate my identity in order to reactivate my account. First of all who sends such sensitive documentation via email to anyone? Secondly, the email address to send such documentation was not valid.3. I really want my account activated because I need the 25 pound bags of cat food delivered to feed  ferals. For the cats I will put up with almost anything.  4. I called the customer service number to find out how to get my account reactivated. It’s inoperable. Try sending a message? You will die waiting for a response.  If you have Tylenol in your medicine cabinet just in case you get the virus then I guarantee that you will be using it for headaches courtesy of Instacart.5. WHY DO BJS,  COSTCO and other big stores allow their home delivery to be powered by Instacart? It makes my membership less valuable. I pay membership fees for the luxury of getting home delivery. I am not getting the full benefit of my membership if my instacart account was deactivated with no recourse."

Does Instacart not vet their delivery shoppers?  The problem with the Instacart website is it asks you if any item is missing? Technically, I get my avocados BUT 3 ARE MISSING.  There is no place on the website to allow me to put down how many avocados are missing.  IT IS A SERVICE THAT IS TOO COSTLY. I WILL NEVER USE IT AGAIN.

The second time was 2 week ago at the beginning of the pandemic. The shopper went to Market Basket and did a good job. He substituted a couple of thing and left 2 things out that I got charged for, but I was mostly happy. I did get a refund for the missing items. The third time was yesterday and it was not good.I was chatting with the shopper and told her 5 times not to make substitutions. If it was not in stock, don’t buy anything, she said ok. I guess what she meant was FU! My order was crazy! I had $175.00 of things in the cart and almost all of them were wrong or missing. She left the actual receipt in one of the bags, it was for $99.00, but they were going to charge me the $175 until I made a complaint. I got food I can’t eat, because of food allergies and some produce that was moldy and rotten. I still have her a good tip, the shoppers are putting their health at risk to do this. But I don’t have money to throw away on rotten food. And the substitutions were bizarre! I got Eggo waffles because they were out of lasagna noodles.

The shopper was in the store for 4 hours!. She repeatedly would replace items not in stock or that she couldn't find with random products I did not ask for or approve. I had to message her several times to put the items back and not to just randomly replace items. She replaced my choice of 8 large avocados with 6 bags of 6 avocados, but when they were delivered there was only one bag of six even though I was charged for all 6 bags. $24! When she delivered the groceries many were stacked on my porch not even in bags, and I saw many of them had spilled  out in her trunk. Nothing was cold. Milk was warm, all frozen food was defrosted. I could not eat any of it. Some of the replacements were not correct or asked for/approved of. Her communication was seriously lacking. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with grocery delivery. Too much of the food had to be thrown out so a credit on my instacart account will not suffice. I will need a refund to my credit card for everything that was cold or frozen as it was all inedible. My breads were crushed under heavy cans, my chips were broken. This woman needs to be fired. I don't know what she was doing in the store for 4 hours as it was not a lot of groceries and the ALDI is a small store with only 5 aisles. I removed her tip from my order but was charged more than my order total by $5. Everything about this experience and order was a disaster.

The response as I received was to hold the groceries for 24 hours until a resolution is determined. I pointed out that I am not a storage centre and want this rectified as soon as possible and would personally be uncomfortable if I found out my groceries were delivered to the wrong address, stores in a strangers home before being picked up and delivered to me.

I've used Instacart for over 6 months and until COVID it was great, so I will cut some slack under the current crazy marketplace circumstances.  HOWEVER, this is just about 100% totally inept and dysfunctional customer service.  I placed an order last Friday for evening delivery-- it showed ""order in progress"" for over 2 hours, with only 2 items shopped, and the delivery never showed up.  On the app my order suddenly was listed as to be delivered on Saturday between 3-5pm.  Again, order was ""in progress"" for hours with the same 2 items being shopped.  When I contacted Customer Service via the app-- because they don't take phone calls!-- I was told the shopper ""couldn't complete the order"", whatever that means.  They had no ability to find an alternate shopper so I would need to be rescheduled until Tuesday, nothing open sooner.  Ok, fine, I understand these are unusual times.Today is Tuesday and the adventure continues.  My order was scheduled for 3-5pm delivery.  Yesterday evening I added several additional items I needed, which is a normal process most of the time.  Around 1pm I get text messages from TWO different shoppers who are filling my order-- but there's only one new order pending in my account.  Neither shopper knew how this happened and neither was willing to ""stand down"", and one is asking me to tell the other to stop shopping!  We three each independently reached out to Customer Service.  One shopper is called off the assignment and the other one, very kind woman, continues.  She delivers my groceries about 1 hour later and (can you guess what's coming??) the order is incorrect!  It's an order I placed 2 weeks ago!  Fortunately there were some same items so I wasn't totally out of luck, but I only received about 13 of 37 items I needed.Back to Customer Service I go, and about 25 minutes hanging online later it's determined that Instacart can get a shopper to pick up & deliver the missing items right away.  Keep in mind I've been very firm but patient through all the communication; giving the benefit of the doubt, and catching more flies with honey than vinegar...  The latest shopper starts buying items I already received so I text her about the earlier partial delivery, and I send her a list of what I no longer need.  She stops shopping, needs to check with Customer Service (starting to feel like a CS drinking game at this point), so another 30 minutes passes waiting.  She comes back online and says all is good and she'll continue shopping--great!  But not so great.  She begins to refund nearly every item on my list, so I text her to ask why because I'm confused what CS told her to do.  She said ""I'm refunding the items you received earlier."", and I tell her ""NO, these are the items I DID NOT receive and are supposed to still be delivered.""  I told her if it was easier at this point for me to cancel the order and she can stop shopping, that's fine-- she immediately agreed.Another reach out to CS, I start my chat by saying ""I've talked to 3 agents within a few hours and my order is still totally messed up.  Please put me in touch with a supervisor immediately.""  The CS agent doesn't object and tells me she's transfering me.  I hung online for 15 minutes, then asked ""How's it going finding a supervisor?""  The agent returned after a while to say she was sorry, but they were ""asking for your phone number and email address to contact you directly.  They will call you back.""  Hmmm, will they, I wonder?  I gave her my info, told her I'm accessible anytime, and here I wait. In the meantime, all this BS has resulted in a pending charges on my bank account of over $200-- the actual items I received were less than $70.I agree with an earlier reviewer that 0 stars should be an option.  Order at your own risk!"

Just received an Instacart final bill for items delivered yesterday.  Everything went very well and I received all items.  The delivery person brought one (1) package of a different brand of toilet paper and explained why.   This was fine.   I went online and increased the tip on my order.Today I got the instacart final bill.   I was billed for 2 (two) packages of the replacement toilet paper at $10 each, $20 total.   There is no way to contact instacart because their phone line today (April 14, 2020) is not accepting any more calls due to corona virus!   I filled out the online form and submitted it.  I don't know why instacart thinks double charging for a replacement item is acceptable.   I cannot afford to lose $10 this way -- not to mention that just overcharging because I might not notice is outrageous.   I will not be using instacart again.UPDATE -- Surprisingly I got an automated response from Instacart already.   However they refunded me double the overcharge by indicating that I did not get any TP - instead of just the one actual package.   To me this is as much a problem as the overcharge.   I do not want to pay extra and I do not want to pay too little.   I especially hope they are not billing the delivery person for the company's mistake in overcharging me.  I'd give the delivery person a 10 (great!), but the company itself maybe a 2-3 for making not one but two billing errors at this point and for having no customer service people to take my phone call (in addition to emails) to try to straighten this out.   While there is a number to call, the outgoing message is that they are not taking any calls currently because of the CV19 issue."

I decided to take advantage of the opportunity for home delivery of the items I ordered through InstaCart.  Once I confirmed my order online, the order total was $140.00.  There was a note at the end of the order saying my credit card would be authorized for $160.00 in the event items I ordered needed to be substituted for other items, which could be more expensive.  Seemed reasonable to me.  On April 11, 2020, I noticed a charge on my credit card for $160.00 for Bjs.  The order was scheduled to arrive anywhere between April 11 and April 16, 2020. This was okay as well as I figured many people were using this service and I was not in immediate need for the items I ordered. On April 13, 2020, the items I ordered arrived at my doorstep, as I requested.  When I checked my account at Bjs.com to determine the actual total of my order since some items were substituted, the ordered totaled $148.05, which they said would show up on my credit card statement in 7 business days.  When I checked my credit card balance, I noticed that Bjs initiated another charge on my credit card in the amount of $160.00.  There are now two (2) separate charges  on my credit card for $160.00 each totaling $320.00 for the order I received today.  When I spoke with someone at Bjs, they said InstaCart initiated the charges om my card and I would need to contact them. When I called Instacart's toll free number, there was no response, which I understand.  Therefore, I sent an email, to which an autoreply indicated it would be while before I would get a response.  Here's what I learned, InstaCart will initiate a charge on your credit card the day that you place the order, and they will also initiate another charge on the day the person shops for your order, if they do not occur on the same date.  And, given the high use of the service, this is likely to happen.  So, my credit card was charged $320.00 for $148.05 in grocery items and I cannot get in touch with anyone at InstaCart to correct this matter.  Fortunately, I contacted my credit card company to request a refund of the additional charge.  Buyer beware, if you are overcharged by InstaCart, you'll have significant problems trying to reach someone to correct the problem."

As a first time user I was shocked by the experience. My shopper started by texted me about my item being unavailable, as I opened it saw options to choose similar items, before I could finish making a choice, another text arrived, then another, then another 11 in all. As I frantically tried to make choices, one after the other, I noticed many choices were twice the price for less product. As a senior on a fixed income I could not afford paying twice the price. I texted the shopper and told her of this. She snapped back saying "" what do you want, I'm doing the best I can.""  As more texts came in to replace items, I tried to select replacements, but with half my order unavailable, I texted her to cancel my order, she ignored my text completely and sent notice of her checking out. I still had more than half the item to review and replace. At that exact time my ability to do anything on the app was over, and was told delivery would be in 20 mins. I texted again to cancel, as my order was half missing or replaced with things I didn't want. I only ordered 19 items, and knew at least half I wasn't getting, the rest, who knows, yet still paying the service fee and tip, over $12. She arrived at my house and I told her I had cancelled my order, but she ignored it. I told her I wasn't excepting it and she got really nasty and rude. When I asked when I would get my refund, she would not talk to me, I kept asking, and was ignored. She slammed her trunk, got in her car and sped off like a maniac. She may have been 18 yrs old, very cocky and unprofessional. I called customer support 5 times and waited on hold for 30 mins plus. The last time I called and was on hold 4 hours to the minute and at that time they disconnected. They charged my card $116, and never refunded a penny. I tried phoning, emailing and no one has gotten back to me in two weeks, yet they are bringing in billions of dollars, with a one star overall review and not dealing with customer issues.

I regretted those experiences so much that I decided not to use them again. Here is a summary of what I saw in those two trips:1- Shoppers are clueless. It took the guy to do back and forth with me about what to buy and what to replace for over 2 hours. How come a shopping list containing around 10 items take that long. In the end I received my delivery but icecream was melted and leaked also I realized that I did not receive some of the items but still got charged for them (market receipt does not match the web receipt in terms of the items purchased) 2-Their mark up is pretty steep. On top of instacart express fee, service fee and shopper tip I still need to pay a mark up on every item on my list. This bussiness model can not survive. They should make deals with the groceries and get special discounts rather than putting the extra fee on the customer.3- For both my trips I had issues with items that I got charged for but did not receive ( I have market receipts to confirm this claim) However no matter howmany times I tried to reach them they were not accessible. So over two weeks from my purchase I am yet to find someone to discuss about my refund...I cancelled my instacart express membership and will not consider using this service ever again.

While this is a trying time for all, if a company is offering a pay service to help those who can not shop, they need to rethink their business, who they are hiring and how these people are being trained.  The final straw was a shopper who repeatedly texted that the items were either not available or wanted to substitute.   We understand that not all things are in stock right now.  We had no high value items on the list such as cleaners and paper products.  All items were pretty basic and while a few out of stock is reasonable - not 50% of the list.  As it turned out, a friend happened to be in the store at the same time as our Instacart shopper.  She texted that some paper products had just been delivered in case we were in need.  I asked her to check on 5 items that our shopper claimed to be unavailable.   All 5 products were in the store and stocked.  When placing the order, I requested that the items not be dropped at the door.  Ring showed the shopper, who was not wearing protection, dropping them at the door and leaving.  My biggest regret is pre-selecting a generous tip. We have gone to the store a few times when absolutely necessary.   It is obvious now who the insta cart shoppers are.  They are moving hurriedly through isles, obvious they don’t know the layout, constantly texting on the visible Instacart app without much focus on the requests at hand. It is no wonder they don’t find what is being requested.  Yesterday I did not see one shopper wearing gloves or mask and often did not follow distancing guidelines.  Unacceptable."

AS FAR AS YOU CAN FROM INSTACART,"Ok. I completely understand we are in the middle of a global pandemic and the demand for these type of services has skyrocketed, leaving many businesses overwhelmed. With that being said this is the absolute worst service I have ever used, if you can even call it a service. I highly believe I was frauded. Please take note of mine and others reviews on here and DO NOT USE INSTACART. This was my first time using this service just like a lot of others because of the quarantine. I placed my order on 4/9 for flexible delivery, which basically you get delivered whenever someone is available. It was scheduled for delivery latest today 4/10 in the evening, however I received a notification on same day as ordered that the shopper was already shopping for it. Not terrible I was pretty impressed at that point that it was going to be delivered early. All downhill from there. This was a large 135 dollar order and every 30 seconds I was responding to a message from the shopper about a replacement or refund for out of stock items. Some items were to be replaced with items that costed more and were less quantity and items were refunded that I personally know the grocery store has because I shop there a lot. Out of hummus? Really? With no replacements? Is hummus a high commodity item in a pandemic?. Anyways, after all of that I get a notification that the shopper is checking out, great right? Wrong! About 2 minutes later I get a text from the shopper that she has to cancel my order because her instacart pay card was stolen. At this point I was over it already and honestly happy that this was going to be cancelled and get my money back. Wrong again! After inquiring how I get refunded for the cancelled order, the shopper states that they are on hold with the instacart support. After about 20 minutes I follow up with the shopper and turns out they disconnected the chat! So no way to contact the shopper or anything! Furthermore, the order was never cancelled via instacart so my order still shows that it is active and being shopped for which is causing a hold on my bank account of 135 dollars. Naturally, after this issue you would think to contact some kind of customer service to get the issue solved which I attempted, however instacart literally has ZERO customer service options. No phone line available to speak with someone, email? well you just get a generic auto reply that directs you to the app to chat via text. Well I go the app to chat and guess what? I’m number 5,000 + in line to chat! After leaving the chat open for about 10 hours, I get no response and it actually kicks me out of the chat! Unbelievable! So, I’m fed up with no food, and 135 dollars practically stolen from me, with no resolution in sight. IS THIS HOW YOU RUN A BUSINESS! Finally, I just resorted to calling my bank (which I was on hold with them for almost 2 hours to get to the clams department) to dispute the charge to get my money back. TAKE MY ADVICE!WRAP A T SHIRT AROUND YOUR FACE, WASH YOUR HANDS AND JUST GO TO THE STORE YOURSELF. INSTACART IS A WASTE OF TIME, MONEY, AND STRESS THAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY DONT NEED. BEWARE! RUN AS FAR AS YOU CAN FROM THEM AND NEVER LOOK BACK!"

But then it added a 10% service fee, the prices for the products from Food Lion were higher than what they were in the store (read:  it padded the bill), and added a tip -- that's the only thing I don't mind paying even though I'd tip more.  The $3.99 delivery fee disclosure is fine but it hid the other fees.  Instacart reminds me of Comcast with its ever higher, undisclosed service fees, etc.  When I used Instacart's pickup service, store employees filled the order.  Out of 10 items, I received 4 and paid $1.99 for the poor service.  I went into the store after the employee brought out one bag before going back inside.  After grabbing a cart, I found all 6 items I wanted still on the shelves.  I even found multiple substitutes which I permitted, too.  I'll never use this service again.

This idea of picking whatever you want to get could possibly be a danger to someone's health. I guess we will chance going to the grocery store and getting sick. Bad business interest for a company like Kroger to sponsor these people. We are not too lazy to go pick up our food and only did this because of the virus."

The person that did the shopping in Publix in Pompano Beach for instacart was dishonest. The app displayed the item that supposedly she picked up from the shopping list. Then she sent me a chat message saying that she forgot to pick up the package of toilet tissue that I ordered. She said that since she had already finished scanning all the items, she could instead buy the package of toilet tissue herself and I could reimburse her on delivery. I asked her how much was the package of toilet tissue that she was buying and she reply that it was 18.18. When she delivered my order I looked at the toilet tissue package of 12 cottonelle mega roll that she said cost 18.18. That package I know for fact cost less than 13 dollars every where including publix. I like a good samaritan gave her 20 dollars and told her to keep the change for her troubles. Once I got to my apartment and saw the package and checked the prices all over the internet for, yes indeed the price is less than 13 dollars. She is such a dishonest person.In addition,  when I looked at the online receipt in instacart, I noticed that they ate charging me for a roll of toilet tissue that she mentioned on her chat that she forgot to pick up?So I am being charge for something that she said she forgot to pick up and she realized it after finishing scanning the whole order?. What a scammer!! And in top of that she charged me and inflated 18.18 for a package of 12 rolls of toilet tissue to reimburse her for her mistake?.I learn my lesson I will never use Instacart and their sleazy shoppers ever again."

So I went to Aldi myself and started shopping.  While I was there I got a text saying somebody is putting my items in their cart now. I found that person and she'd only put 4 items in the cart and she told me she would cancel it out and I got multiple texts stating my order has been cancelled.A FEW HOURS LATER I got a text stating another person was on their way to my house with $150 worth of groceries! I had to rush home and do my best to make room in my fridge for this stuff I hope doesn't spoil. I'm still not sure what I'm going to do with the $30 worth of crap I didn't want.Another shady tactic they're practicing is purposely NOT sending you a receipt after you make the credit card purchase. They do this so they can change the order anytime they want and you have very little proof unless you take screenshots. I can't believe this company is in business."

I wish that I had seen this site before using them. Like others who have posted here, I had a recent bad experience with using Instacart and haven't received my order despite my account indicating that my order has been delivered. It's really feeling like this might be a scam. In a nutshell, I ordered from Instacart yesterday afternoon. Instacart indicated that they could get my order to me within two hours so I was THRILLED (as most of you know, it's literally impossible to get deliveries within a few days or even weeks due to the current COVID-19 crisis). The shopper texted me from the store and indicated that there were two items that were unavailable, which didn't seem strange to me because the stores are out of A LOT of items right now. The shopper and I went back and forth a few times over text because I wanted to know what my options were and there weren't many choices. I texted the shopper that it was fine to get a generic brand or anything else that was similar to the product that I had originally ordered. By this point, we're almost 2 hours into when I originally placed the order. Then, I get a message that the shopper is on their way to my house and immediately after that I get another message stating that they delivered the order (how is it possible that they were on the way and delivered the order at the same time? I figured the shopper might have done both at the house or it might be a glitch in the app or something else). Anyway, I was home so I immediately went to the door and my order was NOT there. Similar to other people on this site, I looked around the house and there is nothing. I also looked in the mailbox which is extra-large so that you can fit packages in there and NOTHING. I immediately texted the shopper who I had just been texting with to let them know that they went to the wrong address and the system blocks me from communicating with the shopper (I guess the program is set up that communication stops after delivery which makes sense to me but not if there is a problem; we could have remedied the problem immediately if the shopper was actually at the incorrect location). I immediately call the number for Instacart and I can't get a rep on the phone and a message from them states that I need to contact them through the app. I go to the chat box to explain what transpired and there is no response. I leave the chat box open all night long and there is still no response the next day. I just received a message from Instacart (like others) that they rescheduled the delivery without my permission and the delivery is now slated for ""Wed-Mon"" (no specific day or time given!). Looking at many of these reviews, now I'm worried that I won't get the delivery and will be charged for it. Mind you I gave the shopper a good tip because they were able to shop so quickly. I don't understand how the shopper could have delivered it to the wrong address. I'm in a location that is densely populated with clear street signs everywhere in a house that is easily identifiable even without GPS. I'm really disappointing with Instacart because I had high hopes for this service but it's clear to me that there are some glitches in their program that need to be worked out. I won't use them again until they can sort all of this out."

At 5:49 pm on the 3rd a person who identified themselves as Alexis P texted us and said she was starting to fill our order. Over the next hour she continued to contact us saying what she could or couldn't find and what she was substituting for some of the items that were out. At 6:46 she texted and said she would be on the way and should arrive in 20 minutes. That evening I tried to contact Instacart only to be told there was a 389 minute wait until I might be able to talk to someone. I didn't wait.She never arrived and she did not respond to texts asking what was going. The next day I contacted the store she had been shopping at. I was told they had no connection with Instacart and I would need to contact them for help. I called the Kroger help line and was told the same information. I called Instatacart and waited this time about an hour until I could speak to someone. The woman I spoke to said she would contact Kroger and tell them to refund my money. She also said someone from Kroger would contact me the next day by phone or by e-mail. Three days later there has been no contact.At this point clearly the three customer service people I have spoken have lied to me.  When I checked my bank statement I saw Fred Meyer had with drawn the money from my checking account, and in fact it was the Fred Meyer which I had called and was told they had nothing to do with Instacart.At this point I consider Instacart and Kroger to be running a continuing criminal enterprise. Kroger sends people to Instacart from the Fred Meyer app thus appearing to a reasonable person to be vouching for their service. Kroger thru Fred Meyer then gets the victim's money while deny having anything to do with Instacart. Instacart says they will tell Kroger to refund the victim's money, which it appears they do not do.As a result I have contacted our bank and disputed the charge. I filed a theft report with the local police department and will be e-mailing the state Attorney General's consumer protection division with a complaint.I will never do business with these companies again."

If my order was supposed to show up ONE hour after the store open, how many orders before mine could possibly push my order 8 hours behind?? BTW, if the store closes at 6:30pm, how the heck they can get the goods around 8pm? They don't even have their acts together to update their automated email system.On top of they're ripping people off with overly-added pricing, which some produce become even more expensive than the organic produce in Whole Foods, they can't even deliver their over-priced merchandise.Forget about Customer Service.

I thought using their service would be a smart move, both for myself and the general public during this pandemic.I purchased about $200 in groceries, paid their ""expedite"" charge, and left a generous (I think) tip of roughly $30 for the shopper; I appreciate the shoppers who are putting themselves out there during the pandemic for us and didn't want to cheap out on them. At first everything seemed great. I got some text messages about the progress of filling my order, authorized a few substitutions, and got an estimated delivery time for that morning. Then it all fell apart spectacularly.I received a message stating ""hurray, your order has been delivered!"" Except, of course, it most certainly had not. I immediately texted back to say ""hey, whatever you delivered was to the wrong address"", only to get a message stating that I couldn't reply to the text messages I had received. Ok, tried calling customer support. Nope, customer support recorded message just says they no longer do phone based customer support. Ok, how about their site? I selected the form option that said my order had not been received and got a canned reply that they were very busy but a customer support agent would jump on the chat soon. 5 hours later and nothing. By now I'm fuming; there's no way I'm paying $270 (about my total charges) for a non-existent ""service"". Called my credit card company to dispute the charges, only to find that Instacart had cancelled the order themselves.So I get to keep my money, but what a COMPLETE waste of time and effort. How in the world does this company stay in business with such an absurdly chaotic and unreliable process? From the VAST numbers of complaints, it seems like it's hit or miss that any order gets completed at all, wasting their shopper's time and resources, the customers time and resources, and, I'm guessing, piles of investor money. Whoever is running this poop show (swear word replaced, but you know what I mean) should be fired and replaced with someone with an ounce of competence.And frankly, I'm not sympathetic to the ""but it's so busy right now"" argument. Creating order from the chaos of high demand is literally what they are being paid for. If it only works when there is an orderly stream of demand the shoppers could just go into business for themselves and fulfill orders directly with customers. Optimizing that work flow and keeping everything running smoothly is their whole business model, and they are failing miserably. You want to see it done right, look at Amazon. They are also getting slammed by massive increases in demand, but they kept it under control by efficiently slicing the demand into different levels of priority and adjusted delivery time expectations to make sure the important stuff (mostly) gets through quickly while less important orders might have to take a bit longer to fulfill. Is it perfect? No, of course not. But it's still functional, while as far as I can see Instacart is crumbling into chaos at the expense of their shoppers and serious unhappiness of customers, while the company adopts a ""who cares, plenty of customers right now"" attitude towards it all."

I have had several consistently bad experiences with Instacart, starting BEFORE all the COVID-19 madness. My first shopper got several items incorrect, so I had to go to teh store myself for the items I needed. For example, I ordered several cases of soda and got 5 *cans*, but they still charged me for the price of a 5 cases. She also brought me bad produce and several other items were also wrong. I paid a lot of money so I could save time during the busy work week only to have to still go to the store and do my own shopping. When I emailed instacart support for refunds and to express my dissatisfaction, it took FIVE emails to get them to not try to sell me an upgraded experience and to at least refund me for the bad produce. I still didn't get refunded for my Instacart fee.Moving on to COVID-19 deperation, I reluctantly ordered from Instacart again. This time,  I had a really respponsive and communicative shopper who texted me about all replacements and asked what I wanted to do. My only 5-star experience wtih this company. Shopping trip 3, my shopper kept cancelling items without asking if I wanted to replace. Very non-communicative, and when I asked her to add a loaf of bread, she told me no because the store was closing. When I asked how many items she had left to get, she said 16. I don't want my shopper to rush through and get bad produce, miss items, not have them check in the back if items aren't out (ALDI often has items in back, and that's where I have them go). For the $$$ I pay to have this service, I want my order to be right adn to be complete. After several messages back and forth, I just had her cancel the order, as I was getting more adn more stressed when items were cancelled and knowing the store was closing.Shoppping trip 4, my shopper was moderately communicative and I was able to get most of what I wanted, with lots of texting of instructions. Still, several items I asked her not to replace showed up in my cart, even after I asked her not to get them. I asked her to add quantities to several items I ordered (ex: 2 pkgs of tortillas instead of 1) and she told me she was being timed by Instacart, so she didn't like to add items. She also texted me to ask if I could reduce my order because she didn't think she could fit all my items in her car. I told her they should all fit in her trunk, as they do in mine. She replied that she can't use her trunk. We got through that and I awaited delivery. I got a text that the items were out front, so went outside after my text came that my groceries had been left (social distancing, so I asked her to leave them), and they WEREN'T THERE. Nowhere. I tried to call the instacart number but there was a 2 hr wait. I tried to log a complaint in my account, but I could only leave a review. Later, my neighbor let me know she had my order sitting in the sun in her driveway. The meat was room temperature, the ice cream was melted, and I have to drive over, load it all in my car and then unload it all at home. Instacart is insanely stressful, expensive and a waste of time. They offer zero customer support (I doubt I'll ever be contact3ed about my experience or refunded for all the items that rotted or were incorrect), zero support for their shoppers (I asked my shopper to contact her employer for help if her car was too small and she said she had no way to reach them) and, as far as I can tell, zero training. If I could give zero stars, I would."

This brings the total to $240 change for my $198.00 bill.  THEN an additional $35 fee was added. When I looked into this additional fee, I was informed on Instacart website that prices may not be in finality as they are indicated on grocery store site (evidencing blatant and undisclosed price gouging on the part of Instacart), and there are videos available from other reviewers expaining that I would be charged per mile for delivery (Instacart selected a Safeway location downtown, when I live precisely .5 mile from a closer Safeway--this is also demonstrable). Instacart itself does not disclose this additional delivery fee. So my $198 (including tax) grocery total is suddenly $275. My credit card was then charged an ADDITIONAL $275 AFTER I cancelled this order REPEATEDLY, for a total of $550 for NO ITEMS,  NO SERVICES, and demonstrably CANCELLED ORDER.There is no way a business can charge you repeatedly for demonstrably cancelled goods or services.

The shopper, Florence, did a horrible job. She would not respond to my questions initially about what substitutions she made for products I carefully selected(due to family with multiple food allergies) until I confronted her about it via a text. I have always in the past been able to have an exchange with my shopper to ensure appropriate substitutions. She did a poor job selecting several different types of produce ; the shoppers usually do in my opinion. Approximately 1/3 of my order was missing due to the items being unavailable at this particular King Soopers. When she arrived, we had a talk about the experience. I talked, and she mostly listened because I was so angry with her customer service skills. She told me that she was limited to a one hour block of time for an order of this size. IMHO, this is not enough time to shop a large order. I am assuming that Instacart shoppers get some kind of training before they start the job, but it was not reflected in Florence's shopping. If I could give a ""0"" star rating, I would."

I have a tan house with no fence at all and my number on my mail box. The app said delivered we said we have not received any groceries. She sent us her number and when we called her. That’s when we found out she delivered to a red house. My husband found a red house with a white fence and the lady said she had no groceries. I spent over 5 hours on hold and sent two complaints online and got an email back that they would get back with me. That was yesterday and I’ve heard nothing back and still have no groceries delivered or charges taken off my card. The driver was not trained on what to do when she delivers to the wrong house and had no way to contact anyone at insta cart to let them know of the error. I’ve never had a driver deliver to the wrong house before so I’ve never had to deal with their customer service.

I understand that during this is a very busy time, and probably more people are ordering groceries rather than going to the grocery store. However, my shoppers made substitutions that I would not have made, and without my authorization. In a couple instances, they brought the wrong products. The order had been promised between 6 and 7 PM, which was not ideal. However, after several emails stating the shoppers were delayed, the last order arrived at 8:30 PM.My last order with Instacart was scheduled for March 23rd for items from a CVS drugstore. Instacart sent me an email saying they canceled the order because the store didn’t have the desired items. In the email, i was told my account had been credited. To date, that has not been reflected in my bank account, and it had been impossible to reach anyone at the Instacart Customer Service phone line.Instacart did not make a very good first impression with me."

Described the issue and the agent placed my wife on hold, came back on the phone and couldn’t hear my wife so hung up. We get a call back and they still can’t hear us, no more contact from a Instacart. We don’t have a problem with our cell, the problem is all with Instacart. I am currently waiting for an agent on a call I started 2 hours and 39 minutes ago, initial estimated wait time was 104 minutes. I have sent a comment explaining our issue on the survey they send after an order is logged as delivered but no email acknowledgment of my comments.

I waited, waited, and I even turned the TV off so that I could hear if anyone pulled up and nothing.

Luckily, I am up doing work so I am not wasting my time waiting for someone to pick up the phone. The automated message keeps telling me that I have a shorter time, then it goes to a longer time.  i.e., original wait time was 62 minutes, then 32, then 68, 42, 21, 23, and the 32, and just now 101 minutes (time 1:07 am).  Screw that!   I also sent several emails, with absolutely no response.  My order was over $100. Once again I looked outside and nothing!

She said she cancelled her end of the order; that put it back in the cart on the app.  Now I can't change, add to, schedule, or cancel the order - it is in limbo.  Since Friday, the message ""your order is being shopped"" comes up.  This has been the case since 9:30 Friday and it is now 12:30 Sunday.  The charges for this order have been sent to my credit card although I never received it.  I e-mailed Instacart  several times but get a standard response to consult the ""help"" menu on the app -- useless.  Their telephone lines are backed up with 2.5 hour waits and no call-back option.  The ""shopper"" who caused the problem is of no help and unavailable.   Do not use these folks until/if they get their act together.  Heard the workers are going on strike Monday 3/30?"

I called my store only to find out she had come in and made a huge scene in the store, and then took off with the rest of my items.  I'm trying to reach customer service, but there is no answer for a very long time.  I would never recommend this service to anyone.  Even tho I am immune compromised, I will do my own shopping from now on, if this is the condition of delivery from Instacart.  I have probably lost all my money for these items, as she ran off with them.  And now I can't reach the company.  Very upset that at this point in time in the world, people do this.Update:  Needed items this week and since things have become so bad in our town, I again ordered from Instacart out of desperation.  The shopper and delivery person this time were the same, and he was fantastic.  Helped me thru chat in the store, and the delivery was perfect - he wore gloves and a mask and was so respectful.  I think it depends on the people involved, but I wish that Instacart had responded to my previous problem.  They never did.

No kidding?! Another hour and a half later I got another text simply saying ""it may not"" arrive that night at all. All texts were from King Soopers, not Instacart. The last one told me to go onto my account to change the delivery time or cancel the order completely. The app and browser wouldn't allow me to do so, so I did what that told me to do: contact King Soopers customer service. I spent an entire day on the phone with them and wow. The first person refused to even take my name and immediately transferred me to Instacart (this is the first time I heard that they were involved). Nobody answers the phones nor do they respond to emails. ALL I WANT is to CANCEL the damn order and get my money back. Instacart is not the company showing up on my credit card statement, King Soopers is. I never agreed to work with Insta and if I had known I wouldn't have done it. The second time I got to a real person with King Soopers I was told that if she canceled my order I wouldn't get my money back and that she couldn't cancel it anyway, it had to be through Instacart, bla bla bla, after I had just nicely explained that I tried to go that way and that my problem is with them, not Instacart. I asked to speak to her boss and what does she do? Transfers me right back to Instacart. Apparently they're going on strike on Monday. I've reported King Soopers to the BBB, sent more emails than I can count at this point, and my next step will be going to my local store to convince the manager than they need to just give me my money back so I can take my business elsewhere. Pandemic or not, it doesn't take over six days for them to simply communicate, cancel my order, and give me a refund. And the ""first delivery is free?"" Nope.

I caution anyone intending to use Aldi delivery, which is with Instacart, if possible DO NOT ALLOW DRIVER TO LEAVE UNTIL YOU COMPLETELY REVIEW YOUR ORDER!!!I am caregiver for my 92 year old mother with respiratory issues. Leaving my house to get groceries is not something I care to do. I tried several grocery stores and ALDI was the only one with a delivery option for my area. I thought ALDI would have been a dependable place for placing my order for delivery. Unfortunately, that is not the case.I hope this review is helpful to anyone with similar circumstances."

I'm okay with that, as long as I can plan for it.  But, every day I've checked, and it shows a different delivery date.  Sometimes sooner, sometimes later.  At one point it said delivery would be between Sunday and Thursday.  Really?  Finally, the scheduled day arrives (today) and the delivery is NOT scheduled, and it says no delivery dates are available.  I'm sure glad I am not down to the last piece of bread or the last square of paper.  Luckily, I had enough forethought not to actually rely on InstaCart to feed my family.  Again - good experience with the shoppers.  They've done a great job.  InstaCart Inc sucks.-----------------------------Original reviewThe service has been good.  I had to order 5 days in advance, but I could adjust the order during the wait time.  My problem is that they are not honoring the prices.  For example, I had strawberries in the basket for $2.99.  But, then it said I had to substitute, and the new price is $3.50.  But, after I approved the price was $4.99.  And, then it's too late to cancel the order.   So, in the end, they are charging whatever they feel like charging.  This was my last order."

After speaking to the instacart representative, Cindy, she said that Wegman’s was the one holding our money. My husband and I found that odd, as we entered our credit card information into instacart’s website. We then proceeded to get Wegman’s on the phone and they said instacart was holding our money. I believe Wegmans. Cindy said that a supervisor would call us back, but honestly sounded like she was nodding off from pills because she was taking forever to say what she was trying to say. Also, no supervisor called us back, so Cindy didn’t follow through on that. Needless to say, this was our first AND ONLY time we will use instacart’s services.

If they can't deliver on the date of my reservation, they need to roll it over to the next day since it appears that a reservation doesn't mean crap.  If they are over promising, then they need to reduce the number of reservations they accept in a day.

I requested again via chat that the shopper drop the groceries off at the new air taxi (there was no other option at this point) and noted I would give her a nice tip, she actually had the nerve to ask what her tip would be, which I did not respond to, and then shortly thereafter I got a notification that my order was complete and en route.

It is unbelievable that someone would steal in a time like this, especially when they have a job!!! This shopper does not know my circumstances!  It is also egregious that Instacart has such a crappy customer service system, and makes it nearly impossible to communicate complaints, concerns, etc. but readily takes the payment/commission for the groceries!

Then I began my shopping.  now I am not the most savvy person on a computer, so it took me all morning & most of the afternoon to figure out how to get my usual products that I normally buy.  When I was finished my shopping I went to check out my cart  & was prompted to select a pick-up time.  I immediately knew this was wrong as I had already selected a delivery time, so I phoned Superstore on their contact number.  I was on hold for 41 minutes until an rep answered.  He informed me that I have the wrong extension, but he would connect me to the proper one. I was put on hold for another 17 minutes, only find out from this rep that Superstore has nothing to do with instacart & that I would have to call their 1-888 number, which I did.....I got put on hold again.

I had specifically put no replacements on the 14 items I order. I was never notified that items were replaced. When the delivery came I ask the delivery person if there were any substitutions, he said I don't know I have a lot of deliveries and took off. I found 2 items that were not correct. They substituted with a higher-priced item that I don't even like and another item they charge the price of the item I order but substituted it with a lesser price item. Try call was put on a 59 minute wait time, then after 59 minuted I waited, they disconnected me. I try to do it on their website and click on report a problem, well after clicking that nothing comes on but my order. It said to click on item that is the problem, I did that and it goes to nothing. I will never do this again. I always thought Costco pride themself on customer service, I am surprised that Costco would even use them. I only did this because of the whole virus thing since I am over 75 and wanted to stay safe. Not worth the aggravation"

The shopper contacted us and while shopping let us know what he was replacing. So far so good. Then it showed us that shopper would deliver within 15 minutes. We waited for nearly 1 and half hours but no sight of any one. On the app it showed us that the delivery was complete. I called instacart and complained they claimed that the delivery was complete as the app showed the grocery was delivered. Finally I asked them to contact the shopper as my grocery was never delivered. They said he left it on the front porch. Well that’s the first place I checked. The delivery guy claimed to have delivered the stuff a very long time ago. I had to go door to door at every house on two streets to ask if they accidentally got my grocery. Well one of them did get it and was happy to give me back my food. But my whole purpose of not having to leave home was defeated. On top of that I got no refund from instacart.

So I sent an email and was happy that they said someone would get back to me within 2 hours.  However, about 6 hours later I got a notice saying communication demands were particularly high and they'd still be getting back to me!  Well that was 3 days ago!

As I was about to leave for my scheduled pick up (between 3-4 PM), I got a text at 2:20 PM saying that ""due to high volume"" it would be delayed and they'd let me know when.  Well I never heard from them again so I drove over at 4:30.  I sat in the pick up area for 15 minutes trying to figure out how to let anyone know we were there.  Finally my partner went inside and an Instacart worker came out (and couldn't manage to remember there was a social distancing mandate in place) and let us know that she couldn't find us on the schedule.  She offered to go inside and talk to a manager and text me.  Which she did, saying that no-one had begun to do my order yet (which was submitted THREE days prior) and did I wish to cancel it.  I texted back that I would not like to cancel it but would very much like to know AT LEAST approximately when it would be ready.  She didn't answer and so about 30 minutes later I went back to the (Sprouts) store to talk to her directly and shop myself if she still couldn't tell me anything.  I had to go inside (defeating the purpose of my ordering in the first place) and find her and politely ask her about my follow up.  I asked if there were any order to how they put the orders together since I had ordered 3 days ago.  She simply said that her manager informed her that I would get it but it might not be today!  She asked if I'd like to cancel it (again) and I (thought: A#@#*) but said:  YES!  That was it, no follow up with anyone.

I refreshed the screen multiple times, and there were no delivery date options available. Oddly enough, about 30 minutes later a new option appeared: 'Delivery within 5 hours' for another $4.00 charge. How is that possible when the system told me it would be Thursday, and then no delivery date options at all?! Out of desperation, I chose this option.

I waited since I was working. However, after 2 hours of waiting, I didn't get a response so I ended the chat.

I'm so so so upset actually,"This app is f---g terrible. I ordered my groceries at 2:00 pm, it told me I'd receive my groceries within 5 hours. Great, no problem. I then got an email that my order would be delayed. And then another. And then another. And then another. And then it said it would be delivered at 10:30pm. My grocery store of choice closed at 10. Finally, at 8:30, I got an email saying to reschedule my groceries because they would not be able to deliver today. I went into the app to reschedule for tomorrow, already incredibly frustrated, upset, and hungry, and it says there are no times available for the next 3 WEEKS. I finally had to cancel my order. I canceled it, and the app gave me NO indication as to whether my money would be refunded, as to whether or not I could report an issue or get any help, nothing. I reached out to customer support via email two hours ago, and have gotten no response. I sent another email just now, and it said I would get a response in 2 hours. A blatant lie, obviously. I called their support number and have been on hold for 20 minutes and am still waiting. I went to the website to see if there is a chat option, and it says there is a chat option in the app. There is no help option in the app and certainly no chat option in the app. I've been waiting all day for food that was never going to come, and there's no assistance to help me make this right. I live in a dorm room with no food. I am out of work. I spent nearly the last of my money on this. Also, the TOTAL came out to $85 and I was charged $130. This is f----g insane. Absolutely f----g insane. This is straight-up the WORST service I have ever used in my life. (Update: as I finished writing this, an automated voice just told me that my estimated wait time is 59 minutes. Which is also probably a lie. I don't know if I will ever get my money back.)"

I want to let all our customers know that when we are replacing items if you don’t recommend a replacement instacart comes up with those replacements so yes sometimes they recommend items that either cost more/less than the items you requested or items that are in no relation to what you ordered. So its up to that shoppers best judgment or to just refund your item. This past week I have been doing orders but unfortunately none of my customers orders can be fulfilled due to items being out of stock due to all the panic buying and stores not being able to keep up. So today after 2 hours of being on hold to get one of my customers order cancelled they deactivated my account claiming “Fraudulent” activity. First off I always speak to my customers to offer them the option to have their order cancelled/rescheduled especially due to the recent craziness. Which means I’m spending anywhere from 1.5 hours or more on the phone or in chat waiting to hear from an agent. Which then prevents me from moving on doing more orders so I’m missing money. For them to deactivate my account at the worst possible time is BS and the fact they didn’t even care enough to reach out before then. I have a 4.98 rating with over 250 deliveries and this is how i get treated as a worker. On top of risking the health of myself and my family by still trying to go out to deliver groceries to those who can’t shop for themselves or choosing to self quarantine. I demand answers !

The second item she texted me and said she was replacing it with an item that wasn't even close to what I was asking for and it cost almost twice what I wanted. I asked for a 4 lb bag of dry dog food and she was replacing it with a 10 oz can of wet dog food that was so expensive it was unbelievable. I texted back no no no but apparently she was already on her way. I never even got the items delivered!!   No one knew where she went or what happened. I called instacart and they were rude as hell. Told me I could get a refund in 15 days. I'm low income and I said that is unacceptable and I will file a bank fraud charge with my bank for your charges. Next day I had my refund in my bank. If I could give them negative five stars I would. Never again.

Blackberries instead of blueberries, everything bagels instead of plain bagels, chicken tenders instead of chicken breasts, and the list goes on. I was also missing several items, and got 1 item instead of the multiples I ordered. Without the actual Safeway store receipt, I have no idea how much it really cost for the wrong and missing items.

HOPE YOU CAN READ ALL THE REVIEWS HERE BEFORE YOU ALSO FALL PREY TO THIS DISHONEST SERVICE I placed my very first order on Monday the 16th, wanting to try it out hoping it would be less stressful for the grocery stores due to the recent outbreak. I pushed the delivery out to Thursday, March 19th between 4-6 pm, one because it wasn't any items I needed desperately, and two because I wanted to give it enough time for restocking. I received about 12 emails from 345pm on staying order was running late and with each email, a later and later delivery time was provided. I wasn't too worried about that. Then, it all went to crap.Several things went bad. My order was incorrectly shopped for/purchased by driver even after I specifically notated in account -NO REPLACEMENT IF ITEM NOT AVAILABLE- I ordered a particular set of tortillas, which I received a COMPLETELY Incorrect, yet MORE EXPENSIVE bag that were marked as *correct* item found, and they are not the item I requested AT ALL, and to make it worse, I find it very DISHONEST that the Food for less receipt the delivery person provided in my bag reflects a purchase for $12.98 for a 12 bottle Dasani water ( which btw, was incorrectly substituted without approval, when I ordered Niagara water 35 bottle/case which costs $3.78/35, geez how convenient is that!!) however in the instacart website, I was charged $24 98. What happened to the $12.00 change difference from that cheaper purchase in store that the driver didn't adjust/refund me?!! Also, why were items I ordered like iceberg lettuce, and laughing cow cheese and toothpaste, not picked up, yet the driver notated ""customer changed mind"" in my order notes under said items.  I went back to food 4 less soon after this crap order arrived, mostly to check the status of their stock and livid, after speaking with an employee who affirmed these are available, because I was curious and wanting to return, I saw with my own 2 eyes the produce items were in store, sitting pretty in their designated spots. Does this kid Nicholas not know what lettuce looks like?! Why were these products not fulfilled?!!?? This is downright dishonest and upsetting to say the least!!! Not only did I get charged 200% more for items that are reflecting to be cheaper in my paper receipt, but I also can't get anyone to speak with over the phone.

BEFORE I WAS FINISHED, THE ORDER WAS CLOSED, AND MY CREDIT CARD CHARGED WHILE I STILL WAS SHOPPING.3.  MEANWHILE, THE HAD ALLEGEDLY CHECKED OUT, AND I WAS TOLD (through yet another text) NO CHANGES COULD BE MADE TO THE ORDER.  I WAS DENIED A CHANCE TO REVIEW MY ORDER/2.

I WAS CHARGED, AND THE THE GROCERIES WERE PROMPTLY DELIVERED BY YET ANOTHER SHOPPER.AT ABOUT 6:30 PM..3. SO WHERE DID THE FIRST SHOPPER GO WITH MY GROCERIES???4.  MY PHONE HAS BEEN BLOWING UP WITH SMS MESSAGES ALL EVENING, AT LEAST 30.AT 7:19 PM  ANTANIKA ""STARTED SHOPPING"" ACCORDING TO AN SMS MESSAGE.  5.  ANTANIKA TEXTED ME AT 7:50 P.M.

The mistakes they made with my order was not the first time and their lack of customer service in resolving in favor of the customer is their policy. I paid them an extra $14.99 in the app to deliver my groceries and their response when making a mistake was to redeliver the missing product later and give me a $5 credit towards a future delivery. How on earth does that make the customer feel whole. Especially when this was not the first time that made this type of error. The credit is useless when you don’t ever plan to use their service again. Upon further contemplation, regarding time and actual services rendered, that they actually stole my money. GOING FORWARD I WILL WARN ALL INCLUDING THE COMPANIES THAT ARE USING THEM TO AVOID AT ALL COSTS. They are outdated in their customer service, delivery systems and are a RIP-OFF!"

The shoppers do not from my experience really try to get the items you want since they are racing through the store at lighting speed.  Plus Instacart will overauth your cc/dc becuz to charge the actual amt of the order and select the right items is not possible. Instacart CS is no better. Use favor if in TX or Shippt. Do not use Instacart unless you want to be conned out of money. They also always accidentally charge service and delivery fees even when you are on a free trial. This happened with me, my father, my sisters and my friends. No one I know uses them anymore because of how corrupt, dishonest and horrible the entire service is.

Don’t use it.,"Instacart is a terrible service.  Don’t use it.  Dishonest, incompetent, don’t care about customers. Their business model seems to be:  Soak the customers for every penny, provide no customer service, lie, and get the orders done fast so who cares if they are always wrong.  Also charge their credit cards for more than the order is worth and take “seven business days” to return the money.They are guaranteed to mess up your order no matter what you do.  So you’ll have to go to the store yourself to get the remaining items or order them on Amazon (another delivery fee, even for Prime members).   It will take you more time, money, & effort than buying your own groceries at the store.I used to be a member, with “no delivery fee”, but instead they charged a “service fee”.  I’m no longer a member, but broke my wrist & live in a walk up building with no elevator. So they charged me a “driver tip”, a “delivery fee”, and a “shopper tip” (which I later reduced to zero, although the screwed up order was not entirely his fault).  So..about $16 in fees for a senior on a very tight budget.  Plus they charged my card $50 more than the order was worth, which will take them “7 business days” (nearly 2 weeks) to return.The shoppers are timed apparently. Which is how they make their 2 hour delivery windows.  So their priority is to get through in the shortest time possible, and they don’t care if they mess up your order.Here were my results from Fairway 86th Street, a store I know inside and out (better than most of the employees there). I had 24 items on my list.  The dishonest suggestion on the Fairway website was that your first delivery would be “free”!  Well in this day & age, “free” isn’t free.  I spent hours preparing the list, including suggested substitutes for each and every item.  The shopper may choose to ignore those anyway, as he only cares about his time window.  I would suggest taking a crucial step, which I forgot to do.  Take a screen shot of every screen on your list, as your original list will disappear after it is shopped.  This is probably deliberate.  Not that it will matter anyway, as you’ll be lucky to even get a $5 credit from Instacart’s laughably named “customer service”.So my results:  Lundberg short grain brown rice. Alternate suggested: Lundberg long grain brown rice. Refunded. Couldn’t find it.  Really?  No brown rice in the entire store?  There are bulk bins of brown rice in that store, but that would take too much time (and effort, and thought)Goya canned chick peas: 2. Suggested alternate:  diifferent brand. Refunded.  Shopper claimed there were no canned chick peas in entire store, sending a photo of 1 shelf to prove it.  I know that store.  They have stuff all over the place.  But shopper didn’t want to spend time & effort to look.Jarrow-Dophilus Probiotics.  Suggested alternate:  another Jarrow version.  Refunded.  I did have a more specific request for a vegetarian probiotic.  Likely there was another one in the store, but shopper didn’t want to spend time and effort to look.Italian roast coffee:  whole beans.  I got ground.Fairway peanut  butter: half a pound.  I got a pound.Honey:  one honey bear, golden honey.  I got 2. One golden, the other wildflower (the substitute suggested). This may have been my fault, but since I failed to screenshot the original list, & Instacart erases it, I couldn’t be sure.Other items: as requested, or substituted with acceptable substitutes.So assuming the honey was my mistake, I had five out of 24 items wrong.  That’s 79% of my original order.   Sadly, this is typical of my experience with Instacart.I ordered the rest on Amazon (another steep delivery fee, since I am a Prime member, but not a Pantry member).So if paying through the nose to get maybe 80% of your order correct appeals to you, by all means use Instacart.  Otherwise, avoid them like the plague.  If you must, screenshot your order before submitting."

Shipt is a much better service and are quick to respond.I also had a notation of where to deliver the groceries and it pops up when I order and the shoppers never follow it and always say they didn’t see it.  They automatically add a tip before you even know if you want to tip.  It’s hard to figure out (after the fact) how to change or delete the tip after your experience.Don’t use this service.  So many better things out there to use.

I spoke with the guy who designed the whole grocery delivery app model and he told me they get 15% from the grocery store. On top of that I caught them marking up prices another on average 10% and then they were adding a $9.95 deliver fee, $2.87 wellness fee and automatically added $4.87 as a tip.

My wife works for instacart and has had nothing but issue after issue. Recently she spent three hours at Kroger because their credit card wouldn't work. So when you take into account the three hours she spent the Kroger plus the gas it took her to get there and then go to deliver the to order she picked up finally after 3 hours and the money she lost by not being able to work for those three hours it cost her dearly. Instacart reply was to throw $10 at her like she was a beggar on the street. She made a whopping $26 for the entire day half of it being wasted so she had a choice need to put the money back in the car so she could work the next day and lose more money or buy a loaf of bread and some bologna and cheese so that our family could eat that night because we had just spent $300 fixing a front axle on the vehicle so that she could do the shopping. So for the next couple of days while I'm sitting here eating my bologna and cheese sandwich I'll be reminded of how peeved off I was about this every time I take a bite.

I have had a problem with this service pretty much every month and in the year using them have been offered a mere $10 credit twice in that entire time despite a major error from one shopper costing me hundreds of dollars, of which instacart was again, very slow to fix and I reported previously here.

I even had to call the store once to verify that a shopper was lying about an item that they removed and stated was not in stock. Shoppers don't read instructions and replace items when they were asked not to, etc - this has resulted in the last four times having to go to the store to fix the issue - which defeats the purpose of ordering delivery!!

The shoppers don’t read customer notes.  And Instacart staff could careless.  Complaints fall on deaf ears.  My husband is bedridden and I’m home with him 24/7, all of my shopping is online. However, from this day forward I will never use another store that uses Instacart.  They don’t care about customer satisfaction.  Sadly, Smiths will lose a longtime valued customer due to Instacarts incompetence. 702-301-6822, 725-2054297."

Luckily I saw text and by chance, could follow shopping and could address issues.   Shopper said store did not carry fresh squeezed oj ever which is absolutely not true as I buy on regular basis—it’s just on other side store with fresh fruit not with reconstituted juices.  Then replaced items with substitutes  when my notes said “Do not substitute.”   Fortunately I caught all this when shopper in store. Called Instacart and cancelled annual membership which I had just started and cancelled order.  Will not use again.   Need more consistency in shoppers.

About 3/4 of the orders have an issue with them, smashed/bad produce, items missing, arrives late, etc. When you call Instacart to correct the issue, it takes them a long time to correct it and sometimes they still don’t correct it. Placed two orders tonight on Instacart, one from HEB and one from Central Market. Central Market order came with a poor substitute for the coconut cream I ordered. HEB order was supposed to arrive by 2 p.m., but didn’t arrive until 5:49 p.m. and it was missing items and also had a poor substitute for an item. It was missing 2 bags of cherries that I ordered, and instead of having my Kellogg cereal that I ordered they delivered an off brand cereal. Called them. They were supposed to resend the 2 bags of cherries, the Kellogg cereal, and the coconut cream, and they were supposed to refund the money for these items and credit my account for the inconvenience. 2 hours later new delivery person shows up with 1 bag of cherries, NO cereal, and NO 2nd bag of cherries. Called Instacart again and was told no supervisor was available to speak with me. This is very poor customer service. The first supervisor I spoke with should’ve been on top my replacement order to make sure that one went right, but they did not stay on top of it and they dropped the ball in it because the “replacement” order was also messed up. I’m going to start looking for a different delivery service. When I first started with Instacart the issues were few and far between, but over the last year the issue have increased and have become very frequent."

A little before 4pm, I received notification on the app that Rose was pulling my order, but when I looked at the app 30 minutes later, less than half the items had been pulled and Rose was no longer working on completing my order. Forty minutes later, an unknown person on the app was proceeding with processing my order, but then stopped. More time passes and then I get a notice via email that my order will now be an hour late, but would be still be arriving. Ninety minutes after my second delivery window passed, I got a call from the shopper saying that they cancelled my order because the store closed at 3pm, which is not true (store was closing at 7pm, not 3pm) and extremely inconvenient because at that late hour, I had no other options to buy our holiday meal from anywhere else, as every grocery store was closed by the time I got notice of the cancellation. My husband also missed three hours of work today, waiting for a delivery that never showed up. He lost wages waiting extended hours for this order to arrive. If the order was going to be cancelled, the notification should have been given much sooner to allow for alternate plans to be made and my husband would not have lost money by leaving work to wait for the delivery, but instead they began my order, then delayed my order, making us think it was still coming, only to cancel it almost three hours after my original delivery time. For my “convenience” the order was rescheduled for the day after Christmas, which is not convenient because I needed it in time for our holiday meal, so I had to cancel the order completely, leaving us with absolutely nothing for our family’s holiday dinner and no means to remedy the situation. To compensate me for the issue, I was offered a $10 credit, which doesn’t help my situation at all. After this extremely negative experience, I will never use this service again as it is clearly disorganized, unreliable and relays dishonest information to customers. This resolution and the way this issue was handled is unacceptable and a very poor and inconsiderate display of customer service. If Publix stays affiliated with instacart as their delivery method, I will no longer shop there. Publix is known for their great customer service, which is clearly not what instacart offers it’s customers.According to these reviews, this sort of poor customer experience is to be expected from this company.

Again, without fail, their shopper neglected to reach out to me when they couldn't find certain items, made adjustments without my consent, and somehow confused cinnamon rolls for biscuits.

My coupons aren't used, my Loyalty card is not used; it's not even allowed. You claim to provide me with coupons and savings, but if I'm not getting the store's discounted price, I'm paying the suggested retail price, which is usually a LOT more, so in the end, I'm really saving nothing by using Instacart. I would save much more money and be able to use my fuel points with my loyalty card, if I go through store to order instead. And if I use their pickup service, then I don't have to pay your delivery and service fees at all.I also want to add that I have learned that you rip off your employees/shoppers. You pay them next to nothing while they slave for hours and wear down their cars and spend their measly earnings on gas/vehicle upkeep. You actually paid them well in the beginning but have since figured out more and more methods of paying them less while making even more money off of their backs. And then recently, if they try and stand up for their rights, you take away their bonuses. I appreciate a 5-star shopper, but now I hear that they don't even get rewarded for being one anymore. As a result, I'm seeing a drop in quality, and I don't blame them. If you're not paying them enough, they're not going to be happy and therefore aren't going to care enough about their jobs to give quality service.You tell your shoppers to not give the customers their receipts. First of all, that's deceitful! But some shoppers don't know this and have given it to me anyway, and when I review these receipts, I can see that I get nothing BOGO, I get none of my coupons, I don't get my fuel points, and the loyalty card being used is not MY number, it's YOUR number. I can see on these receipts that I could have saved $10-20 in most cases... hmmm isn't that funny? That is EXACTLY what my supposedly waived delivery and service fee would have been! So you tell customers if we pay for Express, we're waiving the fees, but we pay nearly full price for everything, so it just puts that money right back on and we're technically paying it after all!I think at one time, Instacart was a great company, but you have since become deceitful and misleading. You treat your employee/shoppers badly, and you cheat your customers by hiding the real truth of what you're charging in the fine print.I'm going to go back to shopping for my own groceries, or using my store's pickup service. There's no way I'm contributing another penny to your company.Save your money. Don't use them. Force them to have no choice but to pay their employees fairly. Shoppers are very often paid less than minimum wage. they are not employees, they are independent contractors, so this is how IC gets away with it. A year or so ago, shoppers went on strike (as is their right), and the bonus they received for having a 5 star rating for 1 week was removed (this was a $100, well-deserved bonus). Recently, they went on strike again on the platform to receive better default tips, and they removed the Quality Bonus, which was a measly $3 for each 5 star rating. Now they get absolutely nothing for receiving or maintaining a 5 star rating. An example of a delivery order they might receive is to drive 10-20 miles to the requested store, shop 56 items, deliver another 5 miles to the customer, bring it to their door with a smile on their face, and for this, Instacart (in this particular example) paid the shopper $7.85! And on top of this, the customer paid no tip up front... maybe they'll pay in cash upon arrival, or add the tip later, but in most cases, they do not.Don't trust this company. they're crooks.

Try Amazon! INSTACART DOES NOT DESERVE YOUR MONEY!,"I have been using Instacart for a few years. This year, I had been using this service multiple times a month, sometimes twice a week. One thing I noticed is that there was almost always something wrong with my order. The last couple of times I used the service, I see the shopper was replacing my vegan items with non-vegan items. I messaged them and told them not to pick up those items. They did not listen. A few moments after I sent the message, they finished shopping, which prevented me from being able to contact them. This infuriated me. I sent instacart two messages informing them that I no longer wanted the entire order because of how rude and dismissive the shopper was. Then I remembered that I could call them. So I called and let the rep know that I no longer wanted this order.It took almost 30 minutes for me to argue my case as to why I no longer wanted the order. As I was on the phone with the rep, the delivery showed up and was placed outside of my front door. The shopper was gone before I could reject the order. The rep was still on the phone as I discovered the food outside my door. I told him that he needed to send someone to pick up the groceries because I refuse to take them. The person offended me by selecting replacements that were not vegan and not meeting my requests. This person was forcing me to pay for items I would never be able to eat. So I told the guy I would instead give the whole order back and go to the grocery store on my own when I had time.The Instacart rep assured me that I would not be charged, and I could give the groceries away or throw them away if I wanted because I would not be charged for them.Because of this, I gave the groceries away. I still continued to use Instacart for over a month. Then suddenly, I received multiple emails stating that my account had been frozen due to a dispute with my bank.I NEVER FILED A DISPUTE. I trusted that the rep was honest when he stated that I would get a refund.They stated that my account would be reinstated after the dispute was settled. They told me that I had to cancel the dispute and pay for the order, then they would refund the items that I didn't want.I explained to them that I was so furious that I didn't accept the order. So I gave the groceries to a family member. I told them that I didn't dispute but instead was offered a FULL REFUND. The stated that I needed to cancel and pay to get my account reinstated.They also mentioned some other charges from 3-4 months ago that they could not complete. I understood this because I lock my card once I'm done with an order. I always keep my credit cards locked. So if they try to charge after the fact, (tip, price difference, etc.) they won't be able to. I told them that this was my mistake, and they could now charge me for the little 3 or 4 dollars. By the end of the chain of emails, I was told that I owed them 100+ dollars, and until I paid, I would not be able to use the service.I asked for documented proof of this, and I never got clear documented evidence. They typed up a list with dates, and I matched it up to find that I only actually owed a few bucks — not 100. THIS COMPANY IS GREEDY, AND THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE QUALITY OF SERVICE THAT THEY PROVIDE.Instead of punishing me, the shopper is the one who was in the wrong, and they are the ones who should've paid the consequences.Today after a long month of going through this, I get an email from them telling me that they can no longer provide services to me, and to refer to their terms in conditions.SO THEY BASICALLY TRIED TO BULLY ME INTO PAYING FOR GROCERIES THAT I NEVER USED AND DISCONTINUED SERVICES BECAUSE I REFUSED TO PAY."

They stop allowing the grocery delivery person to bring you your receipts because they are hiding the fact that they are stealing money from you. I called to find out why my paper receipt was so much less than my emailed receipt from instacart and they just told me it was my fee for using their service. What? I pay a monthly fee for using a service and I also tip the driver very well. This was not disclosed by the way they tried to tell me it was but the statement under prices may vary to store to store made no flipping sense! So this hidden fee and it is very hidden not shown to you at all and changes every time you order, is how they make more money. I would not have a problem with paying more in my monthly fee. This is charging you as high as it can on the items at the store before there discounted or set at the price that usually are at. So you never know what you're being charged and they could not tell me who was receiving the extra payment. Nor could they tell me how much it would be every time I shop. It's completely random. Actually it's on every single item I purchased the price was higher through instacart then it was on my receipt. I then explained to the manager that I would not pay for a service that I didn't know what I was paying each time or ever know what I was paying since they don't tell you! She had to agree with me she wouldn't want to do that either. These people should be shut down by the Better Business Bureau. It's basically like having your lawn mowed for you and telling them to help them self to the spare cash in your cupboard. Now if you're like me I'm not always sure how much exactly is in my spare cash can so who knows how much I paid the lawn person or how much they took. And I never will. Because I didn't get a receipt from him. That is so dirty and disgraceful that they actually are keeping receipts from people! I was wondering why I wasn't allowed to get my receipt like I was being treated like a child. Not allowed? This is a service I'm paying for. Like I said BBB!!"

You’ll get up to date, if your employees made accurate notes about all the calls I’ve made to you, Instacart, my bank, and credit card company customer service. Recap I had $200 set aside for my family Thanksgiving. I ordered delivery of groceries from Kroger.  I’m a senior citizen and disabled which I can’t drive.  Next I get a text from Instacart they're running 2 hours behind. I chatted with the shopper via of text on substitutions. It went silent for about 45 minutes when I get an email, not text, driver needs gate code. I replied via of text and email 154. I get another email ""Meet shopper outside. He can’t find you.""I go downstairs and the gate was propped open, people were moving, and didn’t see anyone in my small half circle driveway entrance/exit in front of my complex. I text and emailed, ""The gate has been open since 8:30pm, my delivery was so delayed it was around 10:15pm.  I asked the guys moving how long they had the gate open.  Your driver's Was at the wrong property."" Next I get an email my order was cancelled! That was our thanksgiving groceries. I sent 8 emails to customer service with Instacart to bring my order. You put a pending charge of $169.07 on my credit card that wouldn’t drop off for 7-10 days. I called the bank, cc company, you, Instacart starting at 4am day before thanksgiving. I only had available $30 left of credit to buy thanksgiving on my card since $169.07 had been deducted for my delivery the night before.  A Kroger supervisor, heartless, said the best he would do is give me a $50 credit.I was furious for so much deception. The only way I could use the $50 was to get delivery! Forcing me to use you and Kroger again when you already had my $169.07. I didn’t see the credit of $50 on my account so I called Kroger and was told to type in “I have a $50 credit“ on a product instructions for substitutions. I couldn’t spend over $30 because I had to put my cc down again and your rep said you wouldn’t make any charges. After checkout the $50 would be applied. This is what happen. You took the amount of groceries from my cc leaving me with no money to buy thanksgiving and to top it off, you had the audacity to charge me a delivery fee plus driver tip. Subtracted from that “$50 credit”. You didn’t give me $50. It worked out to be around $35. Once again you also put a pending charge on my cc leaving $3 available credit. You stole my family’s thanksgiving.I’m sending this to you on thanksgiving since the only thing I had ingredients to make was a cake and bread in our bread machine. I hope you enjoyed your thanksgiving knowing you stole my family’s thanksgiving. We’re new to Dallas so we don’t have anyone to even help us out. I will be posting this on every social network, Kroger’s and Instacart website reviews, App Store, and sending this scam to channel 4.5 and 8. It is so hard on me when I have 3 sons home from college and can’t give them thanksgiving. I feel so stressed out, anxiety, depressed, like a horrible single parent. This is because, even though both companies knew my money had been blocked for pending, we had no groceries, and we would not have any food for thanksgiving, YOU DID NOTHING! You should feel embarrassed and ashamed of kicking me to the street.I want my money released immediately, something to make up for my family not having thanksgiving except for a cake and loaf of bread, and some type of reprimand to every heartless, horrible customer service employee, like Mary, that I pleaded plus begged to help me, the day before thanksgiving, to just bring me my groceries.  I hope my testimony goes viral on the web and others will share it with all their threads.  It is so unbelievably I can’t believe this happen.  How does your company pay your bills?  What type of consumers use your service?  I posted this on FB and a lot of the comments even added your a horrible company to be employee.  You treat your drivers that do the shopping like bottom drawer individuals.  What’s ironic is it actually you that is bottom drawer.  I’m on a fixed income with 3 sons in college, which still did not help escalate this to any authority to solve this problem. I expect a reply that will rectify all the wrong you did to me for thanksgiving.You should be put out of business.  Here’s a problem solver a child could get right: why didn’t you go get my groceries, since you still had $169.07 pending for you to use, and bring them to me?  I don’t believe you even had a person shopping for me the night before.  Knowing your customer service is the worst, you had already admitted you were running hours behind, I don’t believe you even attempted my delivery.  The whole “you shopping” was made up.  It sure was not because a gate was closed, or your driver didn’t have a GPS.  Another possibility, having gotten so many comments on Facebook, your driver could have just quit their job to burn you since you treat them so bad.  You are such a “wrong”, “worse”, “joke” of a company the possibility’s are endless of who despises and has a payback towards you.  I wonder how many of your bills are in the third and last notice status to keep your lights on.  Regardless there’s something not right because no one can succeed treating other people like what you did to my family, and me, on thanksgiving.May you file for bankruptcy!"

Really?  On a Saturday mid day?  No rainchecks on sale items?  2) The instacart website kept pushing me to buy things I did not want by offering money off if I bought a certain amount.  On one of these, I did buy the $20.00 for the $5.00 off, but did not get the $5.00 off.  I did get products I would never buy after looking at the ingredients.  No idea why I didn't get the $5.00 off or if they ever give it.  3) No paper receipt and customer service said store would not honor digital receipt for returns.  What? I haven't tried as yet, but will be shocked if Publix refuses to return money for an item that was 40 DAYS PAST the ""sell by"" date. as well as non perishables I would never have bought if I could have seen the labels.  If I ever did use this service again, or if you want to try, I would avoid the promotions like the plague.  Huge waste of time and money.4) Non disclosed charges (a $2.00 fee to deliver a bottle of cooking wine) Customer Service said they did not see the fee which was a surprise on the digital receipt which customer service ZEN DESK) kept referring me to.  Why can't they see it and why did they lie and say I was not charged a hidden fee that was clearly on the receipt?5) ZEN DESK is awful and has been driving me crazy with contradictory emails that have wasted more time than it would have taken to go and buy the things I actually wanted to buy.  They have issued credits for the wrong items and refuse to even try to figure it out after asking me detailed questions they then ignored the answer to. They refer to credits as refunds but to get them I would have to use this awful service again.6) This is supposed to be a convenience, but it turns out you have to be in constant chat with your shopper, and everything has to be written twice as instacart doesn't seem to ever like the first way you respond. (phone or computer)  It is neither convenient, time saving and it is very expensive with hidden fees and clearly underpaid workers who have no motivation to be good shoppers.7) A bad service, terrible customer service and no way to communicate with the company.  When you try to leave feedback they only want to know about tipping and if you liked the poor person working for them.  No way to let them know about problems with their service or charges.  They hand you off to Zen Desk and they haven't got a clue and only waste more time.Finally, If this were a reliable and convenient service who did not push purchases of garbage with discounts they don't give, if they kept up with store inventory on any level at all so most items that really are wanted can be purchased, I would not mind paying the over 15% surcharge plus a real tip. However for this bungled mess I feel I should have been paid."

HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"It's true that Instacart charges more, often a lot more, for items than the grocery stores do, but I was WILLING to accept the costs in exchange for the convenience.  That premium, however, should also mean that if SOMETHING IS WRONG, that the customer should have the confidence to know that Instacart will make it right.  THEY DON'T, THEY WON'T, AND THEY REALLY DON'T CARE.  You mean NOTHING to them.  NOTHING.I recently purchased two one pound containers of crab meat from Wegman's using Instacart.  I was heading out on a week long vacation and didn't have time to do the shopping, so I was glad to have a service like Instacart to help me out.  I was heading to a very rural area without cell service and wifi, and my parents had asked me if I'd bring some crab meat since they can't get it where they live.After arriving, I unpacked the crab meat from the cooler and noticed that the expiration date on the bottom was APRIL 2019, and it was already late October of 2019, so the meat was SIX MONTHS EXPIRED!!  Each tub, at Instacart prices was $30, so we're talking $60 worth of expired crab meat.  Clearly, the Instacart shopper didn't check the date, and by the time I did, I was 500 miles from home with no way to remedy the situation.Upon returning home 9 days later, I went to the store to make a return.  I was told that since it was Instacart, I'd have to contact them and do the return through them.  I immediately contacted Instacart and explained the situation.  THEY REFUSED TO REFUND THE COST OF THE EXPIRED PRODUCT BECAUSE, ""IT HAD BEEN MORE THAN SEVEN DAYS SINCE IT WAS PURCHASED.""  So, it didn't matter that their shopper delivered expired product to me.  It didn't matter that the product was SIX MONTHS past its expiration date.  It didn't matter that I was unable to attend to the matter while I was away.  It didn't matter that I was a loyal customer that got grocery deliveries every week.  NONE OF THAT MATTERED AT ALL.  So beware.  If you need a grocery delivery service, then honestly, I'd look at a different source.  Instacart is not worth the risk if they are unwilling to consider legitimate customer complaints."

Back then, I thought their service was top notch.  Deliveries were always on time and the shoppers were well trained, but that was then.  I canceled my account on October of 2019, after months of missing items; that I was charged for; products that was out of date, bad, and just plain old and moldy; and shoppers and delivery drivers that had no idea how to shop.  But what broke the bank was that I placed an order for delivery the next day, somebody shopped the order, then a separate driver picked up the order, my groceries rode in the back of the delivery driver's trunk, in 80 degree weather, for 1 whole hour, until she showed up at my house.  The meat I purchased was warm, smashed bananas, my frozen pizza was defrosted, and most of my produce didn't last as long as I should have.It took 2 days for Instacart to answer my complaint email, in which time I canceled my express subscription.  When Instacart answered my email, they offered me $7.59 refund and one more month of the express subscription, that's when I canceled the account.During the last year (2019), is when the service has really gotten terrible, as Instacart has enacted even more rules and regulations.  Very rarely did the delivery drivers have temperature controlled bags for refrigerated goods, and many of the drivers just care about getting a positive feed back score. What Instacart really needs to do is to better train their workers how to shop, how to bag groceries, shadow shoppers and delivery drivers to make sure they are doing the job they were hired for.The grocery delivery business is big, but Instacart has missed the mark."

At the beginning of 2019, my orders were on time, every single time. It seemed that the person shopping the order was also always the one delivering the order, which seemed to work very well. However this changed at some point and the shopper was separated from the delivery person.The consistent issue I have run into as a result of this is that, while the shopper finishes shopping my order usually within a half hour of ordering, the delivery happens late every single time. I usually get a notification some time within the delivery window that the order is late. This would be okay if it was once in a while, but it happens during every single order now.I select the ""within 2 hours"" whenever it is available. Sometimes it is not available, which signals to me that it is not possible for a delivery within 2 hours...fine, that's logical. However, when this window is available, I expect (as a paying Express member), that there is sufficient shoppers/delivery couriers available to make the order delivery on time.I just cancelled an order today because it was late and I didn't even receive a notification. Having called customer support for this same issue three times before, this time the agent informed me that Instacart cannot guarantee delivery within the selected window....even though Instacart has the ability to change the available windows based on service availability. This unfortunate fact is not found in the terms of service to my knowledge, which is understandable because I'm sure it would likely not be good for business. I am no longer confident in the quality of this service and will no longer be using Instacart. The 10% markup, lack of price adjustment for in-store sales/promotions, and Express for $99 per year is no longer worth it if I can't even get an order on time anymore."

I asked to have my money refunded into my bank account immediately, and was advised that it takes 3-7 business days for a refund (on something I never received in the first place).

I never would have signed up if I had realized.Oh, one more thing - there is no easy way to block the shopper from substituting another item if they can't find something on your list. Supposedly you can text them to let them know (???) -- I would rather just click ""no substitutes"" when appropriate."

Avoid!","I thought the idea was great. I paid a $99 subscription fee. I normally physically shop in the supermarket but felt a delivery service would come in handy at times. My one and only use of the service was not for delivery - but a car pick up at the store (there are several parking spaces reserved.) I knew I would have my dog with me in the car that day and did not want to leave him in the car. The ordering was easy. The store actually tracked my car and came out with the groceries as I arrived. Very convenient. There was a $4 pick up fee that was waived for the first use of the service. I was not given a receipt and would have asked for it had I thought about it at the time. I got home and was able to print out a copy of the order with itemized items. A week or so later, I asked an InstaCart shopper in the same Publix store what their pricing policy was. She told me the prices were the same as the in-store prices. Not true. I went back to the store with my printed order and checked every price on the order. I found that there was a minimum price increase of 11% across the board. Some prices were much higher. Sale items were the only prices that matched the store's. I understand this is a service and I realize that it is a business that must turn a profit. But I did not like the fact that the InstaCart shopper mislead me (I won't say lied) about the pricing. I called to ask for my $99 subscription fee refunded. The guy on the other end argued with me until I finally told him I was extremely angry and to either give me a yes or a no on a refund. I was put on hold several times and the entire process took longer than 30 minutes. This service reminded me of a hotel booking service where I had a similar bad experience. The service might be good for the elderly, people with physically limiting debilitations, pregnant mothers, and people without transportation though this is certainly not an endorsement for this company. For the rest of us, it is probably more practical to do your own shopping or delay your trip to the store when you can get in on your own. Definitely avoid this company."

That happened. But.... unlike my first Instacart experience, I found the shopper’s receipt in my bag. I asked the Instacart customer service rep questions about how they price items. The outcome of our conversation reveals what I think is a dishonest business practice. At least two produce items on my Instacart receipt were listed at a higher weight than the weights on the Sprouts’ receipt. It is not a lot of money, but are they doing this with orders on a regular basis? Who is going to bother weighing their produce to double-check? The rep informed me that I should not have received the Sprouts’ receipt — it would be marked as a missing receipt from the shopper. What a convenient way to keep the consumer unaware of their business practices! I thanked the rep for being polite, but said I think this practice is dishonest and will not use their services again. (Instacart charged a service fee and delivery fee on top of the Sprouts’ receipt. I thought these were how they make money.

But if you’re able to hang in there, you’ll see what an absolute joke this company is. If not, just know I will never use instacart again or recommend it to anyone.I had been dealing with issues with instacart for almost two weeks. My father used my account for a purchase, then decided later on to create his own account. After his first order, instacart flagged his purchase, canceled it, and deactivated his account. We called to confirm that it wasn’t fraud and ask why this happened. Instacart’s reasoning changed every time I spoke to them. At first they said it was because his first order was too large and they thought it was fraud. We tried to confirm that it was us, but they would not allow us to reactivate his account over the phone. Instead they asked him to send a copy of his drivers license and credit card over email, which is absolutely ridiculous. I can confirm my identity through companies like Bank of America over the phone, so why I can’t confirm over the phone for a simple grocery delivery?Instacart also deleted my father’s credit card from my own separate account since the card was “flagged”, which wouldn’t have been an issue if they would have allowed me to add a new payment method, but they didn’t. Every time I tried to enter a credit card, I received an error code. I called them again and they said it was just an issue with their system and to try again in 15-30 min. When I called again, they said I was probably using the wrong web browser. When I confirmed that I had tried several web browsers, different credit cards, and THEIR OWN APP, they finally said they would escalate the issue into a “case” and that someone would contact me in 24-48 hours. 48 hours later, no one had contacted me. I call again, explain the issues with both my father’s account being deactivated, my account not allowing me to add a payment info, and no one following up with me for 48 hours. The customer service agent told me someone at instacart closed our case without speaking to us which is why no one contacted us. She also said we DID NOT have to send our drivers license and credit card over email, and guaranteed that she herself would get back to me in 24 hours. She never did. I call back two days later and request to speak to a manager because now the new customer service agent claims they have no information on the issues that I’ve been calling about for days. The customer service agent tried multiple times to get me to end the call and agree to another callback but I refused, because no one had ever called me back before and I did not trust that they would follow through. I sat on hold for an hour when a manager finally got on the line. He said that sometimes these issues take at least a week to be fixed, even though they had originally said 24-48 hours. He said the problems in both accounts will be dealt with by the following week.A week later, I receive an email that MY account is now deactivated (dad’s is still deactivated too, no change there). Once again I call customer service and they claim they don’t have any information for me at this time, so I ask again to speak to a manager. When the manager gets on the line, I have to reexplain what happened and that now my account is deactivated, as well as my father’s. He first says that this is because the bank hasn’t verified our info yet and that it’s not their fault. When I question him more about it, he then says it’s because we haven’t emailed our drivers licenses and credit cards and that they can’t confirm our identities without them. Again, I tell him we do not want to send sensitive information like that over email and that an instacart employee told us we did not have to do so. He claims that employee is greatly mistaken and that our accounts won’t be reactivated until this happens. I ask why my account was even deactivated in the first place and the manger claims it’s because it is related to my father’s account. Please note my account and my father’s account are completely separate (different acct number, different address, different names). The only similarity between the accounts was the credit card my father used when he used my account to try out instacart (He’s 60 and not tech savvy). At this point I am beyond frustrated with instacart’s stories constantly changing and them not being able to provide any accurate information. I told the manager there is no reason that my account should be deactivated just because it had the same credit card stored, and that it does not say anywhere on their website that using the same credit card for more than one account is not allowed or recommended. Plus I could not change what credit card was saved anyway since instacart would not allow me to add a different payment method. The manager refused to listen or address my previous issues with their customer service team. He just kept stating that our accounts would not be activated until we submitted our DL and CC info over email and that we were the ones causing instacart to take so long in resolving the problem. He said he didn’t get why it was so difficult for me to understand what he was requesting and that it was just plain “common sense”. I told him he was being very rude and unprofessional. He laughed, denied being rude, and just kept repeating that it was just common sense. I asked to speak to whoever was above him and he said he was as high as you can go. At that moment I told him to delete both my account info and my father’s, and that we would no longer be instacart customers or recommend instacart to anyone. In his own words, leaving instacart was just “common sense”. Beware of this company. Use at your own risk."

On weeks where I need items from there, I also order most of my groceries at the same time. It's not super convenient to get there by public transport so I was excited when I found out about Instacart. Unfortunately, they are simply not willing or not able (or both) to provide the service they claim they will. Roughly half of my orders have had missing items - not items that were out of stock but items the shoppers claimed they found and that I was billed for but that mysteriously didn't make it into shopping bag. This latest order, in addition to a critical missing item, also had the wrong variety of another item. I'm a pretty understanding person and we all make mistakes, but unfortunately with Instacart if the shopper screws up your order, there's basically nothing you can do. You can't get hold of anyone, and using their website interface to report a problems is virtually useless. They will promise to refund you but not follow through, and forget about getting any sort of additional credit for the inconvenience of them screwing up. Last time it took me about eight emails to get a refund issued. The other problem I have with them is they send me emails promising a promotional credit (such as free delivery or x amount off an order), not related to missing items, these are more general promotions, but then when I go to order, there's no way to actually claim it. In any event, I'm done. I will spend the time to send them another eight or ten emails to get a refund for this latest screw up, and then I'm out. It's just not worth it."

EVER.  EEEEEVVVVEEERRRR!!!!,"I am in my two week trial period and have placed 2 orders.  The first order was over an hour late, and there were mistakes made.  (Regular instead of decaf coffee, product over 1 month expired.)  But she tried hard and I gave it another shot.  The next order was much bigger, so I assumed they'd adjust for that.  Wrong!  My delivery preference time was 9pm.  My groceries didn't arrive until after MIDNIGHT!  I kept getting alerts from the shopper who was substituting products we didn't want, even though I picked replacements for those I did and specifically messaged the driver to say please don't make replacemements.  The messages stopped around 10:40 when instacart sent us a message saying our groceries were delivered.  But they weren't!  At 11:30 pm I called the 1-888 number to find out where my groceries were (you can't contact your driver while they're in checkout), and they said the system shut down at 10:30 and deleted the rest of my order and with it, my address.  So she had to call my driver to find her, and she had been hanging out with my groceries for over an hour with no idea where to go!  They asked if I wanted the groceries to ""spend the night"" at her house and be delivered the next day.  Think about it... Over $400 of your groceries, already thawing because it's been 3 hours since she shopped the freezer area, now overnight in a stranger's house that you can't vouch for their cleanliness or reputation.  No, thank you!  When I complained, the company offered me a $10 credit.  I laughed out loud.  They then offered me a $50 credit, but unfortunately it means I would have to place another order with them to redeem it.  No way.  I told them I would tell the world about their horrible service and company.And pay close attention to the pricing.  My original order was over $500.  Because she couldn't find some items or substitutions, my final bill came to $411 before I had to tip.  But when I got my receipt, only $361 of groceries were purchased.  (And no, it's not because of the club card.  They used a number different from my own, so I could see the discounts but got none of the savings, and the discounts were not reflected on my final bill.)  So the prices were $50 higher on instacart than if I had gone into the store myself.  This company is a poorly run ripoff.  If you want to feel like you're in a bad beta trial, choose instacart.  Myself, I'll keep choosing delivery pick up at Walmart and Fred Meyer."

While I greatly appreciate people's efforts in learning English, if you cannot effectively communicate with the customer when you're required to, you should not be an employee there. In this particular experience leading me to write this review, not only was my order 2 HOURS late, it was sent to FOUR DIFFERENT SHOPPERS after the order was already bagged and completed the first time. Because of that, the order had to be redone multiple times. The final time the order was placed, over half of my order was wrong, I paid more for items NOT in my order, and the majority of the notes went ignored because the shopper did not understand simple English. This is not the first time something like this has happened, where my shopper did not speak English and screwed up my order, but this was certainly the worst experience I've had with a delivery service and I will no longer be using Instacart because of it."

For awhile it seemed Instacart may have possibly devoted more time in the TRAINING their people how to shop as I had suggested many times while speaking with their CSR. Anyway. Fast forward to today. My delivery directions are: Please leave the groceries in front of the garage door. I have 4 huge dogs so it’s easier that way. Today I opened the garage door as soon as I received the text that my delivery person was en route. I sat in there waiting and waiting and waiting until I received the standard text to rate the experience. I promptly called Customer Service to get the girl to go back to the wrong address while she was in the neighborhood and pick up my stuff that was sitting in a typical summer downpour. Well that didn’t go over well. At all. In fact the CSR told me that I was being unprofessional and she would have to terminate the call as I was getting highly frustrated enduring the scripted niceties...while trying to get her off the call to go catch the driver .  In the end, they reordered the entire order instead and I had to wait for another delivery. The dumbest system ever. With business practices like this I don’t expect they can keep taking losses for too much longer. So dumb. So, so dumb.One more thing. How dare the CSR threaten to terminate my call because I was upset!!! How is that customer Service.Looks like I’ll be using shipt or Amazon’s delivery service. (Excuse any typos)"

I was really ill so I couldn’t do the shopping I normally do for my niece. We went over each order several times verifying the prices and ALWAYS selecting TO NOT REPLACE AN ITEM. The shoppers threw things in I didn’t order. This happened on almost every order. I called and got some credited back but other times I wouldn’t catch them charging me for things they gave me in exchange for another one or didn’t give me but claimed they did. A new CS agent was the only helpful one only because he was too new to lie and gave me info the supervisor said I shouldn’t have been given. I also didn’t get my referral credit. They said they would put it on my acct but they won’t credit my card. I will never use them again so I basically never received the credit. If you are in TX use Favor instead. They are phenomenal. I have just gotten well so now I am having to contact their Leadership to get my refund. I know it has to be around $100. I live in a house with a lot of people so everyone had their own accts. It was my turn to pay for groceries so we used my card but on each persons acct. They only signed up because it sounded like a good idea. I also didn’t want to pay a service fee before I knew how good their service was. Yet I still got charged service fees on many of the orders when it was a “free 14 day trial”. DO NOT USE unless you like paying for items you either didn’t order, are melted, in bad condition (about to be spoiled veggies n fruit) or items you were charged for but never got. I also forgot to mention that THEY WILL NEVER HAVE YOUR DELIVERY WITHIN THE TIMEFRAME SELECTED. I am a shopper as well for other companies so I know how this works.

First, they up the price of every item, they charge you delivery fee, service fee, and tip. I know the idea is to pay for some of the convenience, but they really take your money in every way. You end up paying about $40 additional after delivery. When you order, shopper says they can't find the item and replace it with an item that is double the price of the original. Every time I ordered at least 4 items doubled in price. So why list those items, if you don't have them? Then they say you can substitute, but even if you say you don't want substitutes, and write special instructions for items-to not substitute if above original price, shoppers still do it. Result, your bill is at least $25 above original bill, then they offer to waive your delivery fee of $3. Wow! Awful customer service, no real interest in listening to customer and providing them with what they asked for, including honest customer service, but instead their interest is to make as much money from the customer, in every way possible.

Ordered a 24 pack of pepsi which was $9.99 but they were having a sale of x2 24 packs for $4.99 each so the shopper tried to message me about it and when she was unable to get ahold of me just added it on since it was a better deal for a slightly lower cost. But the shopper manually entered pepsi 4.99 x24 instead of 24 pepsi 4.99 x1. So that ended up throwing on $4.99 x24 = $119.76 plus the increased tax from this, plus a now $15 deposit fee. Instacart not only charges you early, they charge you a little more than the total to account for adjustments, so for a $60 order I was charged over $200.When I called I got someone who simply could not comprehend what was going on. It was the most infuriating experience I have had in awhile as I stared at the actual store receipt trying to dispute that the instacarts version was wrong. Not only did this create other problems for me, it was long and slow to fix, and I ended up giving up and taking a smaller refund because of their incompetence because of medical issues(why I was using their service in the first place).

As the old saying goes,  three strikes and you are OUT,  and trust me INSTACART is OUT in my book.  I felt that I was being a very good and patient person for giving them the two additional tries..Rather like a teacher in school giving a kid two outs before they go to the Principal's office, but truly?  I want to ROAR with laughter (not in a good way, )  when I see the ads for Instacart with the clean cut guy coming to the door with the fresh pressed green apron and the family smiling around the table.  That my friends...is the genius of advertising to make Instacart look good.    What it should really look like is a family with their tongues hanging out of their head with hunger and thirst before they arrive, a disheveled looking delivery person who doesn't even bother to comb their hair or shave,  and has NO INDICATIVE clothing that they represent Publix at all..  George Jenkins would be mortified having two of the delivery people show up at my door the way they did.    But trust me,  the bad service actually starts with the shoppers, and I think it has to do with the store itself at 33433 because even as a customer in that store,  the service is nasty and crabby to be honest...how could I possibly expect the Instacart Service to be acceptable.     Let's see....Ummm.  Three deliveries ago I had a person who could not speak English to me,  was rude on TOP of not being able to communicate effectively.    When you push the button to say that your order is final,  they write a disclaimer saying that your frozen items will be kept in a temperature controlled bag so that you get it in good condition (arrives in an acceptable manner.)   Well,   that guy  brought my things in regular plastic Publix bags such as those at the end of the register that a bagger uses to bring out to your car.    My ice cream, butter,  and pot pies  (the crust on the top you could put your thumb through when it arrived to me  that is how thawed out it was.  My ice cream  you could pour it out into a glass and make a milkshake when it arrived to you,  you didn't need to add any liquid to have that happen.   I told the driver that,  and all he could do was shrug  and tell me that he had two deliveries before me..  WHY  WERE MY THINGS NOT IN A TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED BAG?  I called the 1-800 service number  and all they offered me was to send someone back out...  MY DINNER WAS IN THIS ORDER and I was so hungry  I told them that they were out of their mind and I was not going to wait another two hours to have them turn around to fix their mistake that should not have been made to begin with if it had been packaged correctly.  Not only that,  but  I had detergents in with food items..  Tide in with my Raisin Bran...I remember this distinctly.  Food was not with Food..   Chemicals were not with other Chemicals...    Round Two,  when I decided to give Instacart another try,   I had this time a shopper  who messaged me every 30 seconds to say that she was replacing something...I mean it..  every thirty seconds.....I measured it precisely by the t.v. show I was watching  that the show would have an ad,  I would get one message...  the ads were not over yet,  and I got another message to say that she was replacing something else.   This shopper was clearly in a hurry with what she wanted to do after this shopping assignment was done... she had a date... a nail appointment,  Happy Hour at Flanigans  I don't know, but her mind was NOT on my order...  she messaged me CONSTANTLY to say that she had to replace something...she just wanted to get out of the store.  How do I know this?   Okay....  I called Customer Service  I told them the above that she was doing this throughout the store,  and again they offered no  ....solution....  so I had them cancel the order....  I went the VERY NEXT DAY  when the STORE OPENED at the same location that my shopper would have been to,  I went with my list  of the things that I wanted because I took it off my order on the computer.  .....I went through every aisle  and FOUND EVERYTHING I WANTED without substitutions...there was no need..I found every item on my list in that store....without having to ""replace"" or substitute a blessed thing.  No excuse... That shopper clearly did not want to do what she was doing..... no excuse.     Strike Three:    This laSt time... not rhetorically speaking...this was the last... ever!!...From the time that my phone ""dinged""  to tell me that my driver was on their way I called my gatehouse..because it gives an estimate of the time that it will take for your driver to get to your destination...that indicator said 10 minutes...which makes sense from Garden Shoppes to me...that estimate is right by computer standards.....  I called the Gatehouse and said that they would be there shortly......  45 minutes later...my driver arrives.... I said to myself before they got here....  ""They have my ice cream.....I can't wait to see the condition of this order.""   He gets to my door...  This delivery person looks like he SLEPT in his car...his appearance is horrific .... no shave....his hair is uncombed...  I look down  where he had the PAPER BAG (a regular standard Publix brown paper bag... and in it was my ice cream....  I said  (oh I was furious...I had wrote everything in comments...please keep my ice cream and frozen items in a temperature controlled bag.""    The shopper said ""We always do that...but I am not your delivery person, I am only your shopper..... but they do that anyway.""     Really...  really>   I said to the delivery person..  ""YOU GIVE ME THAT BAG... ""  Never mind...I took it off the GROUND  where he had it  (not like the delivery guy on t.v.  who is smiling and handing it to at the door,  you're not reaching to the damn ground as the customer to get it.... that ad is a JOKE and an insult to the consumers intelligence...take it off t.v.  its misrepresentation  all the way...)  and I said ""You stand right there..... ""    I took it into my counter... I squeezed it...and both my Ben and Jerry's and Breyers  where SLOP...SLOP... total mush..  I had the delivery guy feel it,  and he shrugs his shoulders.   I said ""Where is your temperature controlled bag?""    He said ""My What?""  I said ""YOUR TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED BAG that you put freezer/frozen items in...""I don't even know what that is...they never told me about anything like that.""   ""You don't know what that is?"" ""No they don't tell us anything like that...  Listen Lady  I had three deliveries before you....""   Well that's just all wrong right there.   He just uttered the magic words of the entire transaction..  He went around to three other places before my place...  The estimate was 10 minutes,  and he took 45.... and he didn't have my frozen in a temp controlled bag because he didn't know what it was.  and and and with all that,  I was his Fourth Delivery...... He didn't bring my water inside the house  he had it on the other side of the doorsill that I had to pick up myself and I have an Emotional Support Animal it is very difficult for me to go to a store to shop,  I try to alleviate this issue by using Instacart,   so there's another thing added on to this travesty of a service.... I called the Customer Service Line for Instacart yet again....  THat person tells me that they can come out, pick everything up,  and bring back a new order.   I HAD BEEN WAITING NOW THREE HOURS FOR THIS ENTIRE DEBACLE   AND THEY WANT TO REPEAT THAT?  I WAS FAMISHED...MY DINNER WAS IN THIS ORDER... which was the Pot Pie  (Marie Callenders)  and I didn't even need to wait for it to thaw, because that was done for me.      My butter was on the way to getting soft...on the way to it....but the top of my other pot pie you could put your thumb in it  (again,  like my order from above a few months ago  on my first go round... )  and you could feel the crust go down under your thumb....   The delivery person did not apologize at all...not one bit... not an iota,  his only thing he had to say leaving was that he had three people ahead of me before he walked away from me....before I bent down to get the 24 pack of Zephyrhills water inside the foyer.....    The Super Bowl ads were a scream to me,  and not in a good way,  I'm being completely facetious when I say that... Again...another happy smiling  guy with a clean pressed Publix Apron...   and the party was still in full swing when the guy got there and nothing was thawed out.  Trust me,  with any of these delivery people?     They need a class....they need a class on what they're doing.....No one  No one should be offered over the phone...okay  ....for an order to be picked up as a consolation...it needs to be done right to begin with..... from the word Go.....  you got the wrong person when it comes to writing a review because I am a Product Liability Paralegal,  and I pay attention to service every day in my job.   Something has HAPPENED to this service that  needs to be paid attention to.....  These people need to be able to 1) Communicate Effectively and not shrug their shoulders as an answer  2) Not be half a-----ed when it comes to what they are doing  (when I went to the store and found everything the next day after being told they needed to substitute  every thirty seconds....)  and just plain LOOK BETTER in the process.  To be honest...  Publix SHOULD be hiding the name of their apron or not wear them at all, because this is not the Publix service I know...

I wanted to use a coupon for $10 off my first order and it didn’t seem to be applying to my order. I contacted customer service and asked about it. They then said that I needed a specific  item total. I asked if I added another item to meet the total, could i get a refund. They said yes and then when I asked about my refund, they said there was a misunderstanding about the item total versus the order total.So I can see from that perspective why my coupon didn’t apply but the coupon didn’t even mention a required total in the first place and they really shouldn’t have promised to refund me without carefully looking at my totals and order. No apologies and they don’t even care to lose me as a customer.  Very disappointed.  Sorry but please don’t trust them. I’d assume if an order was wrong or not delivered, they’d have the same terrible service and refuse to make it right."

I will call my credit card company and dispute the entire transaction and I will tell everyone I know about the terrible experience I had.The person in the phone today was the worst experience I ever had.I reminded her that I was only asking her to do her job and she continued to talk over me and refused to give me any information about the refund that was promised.Terrible and frustrating...

I work from home, so instead of having a full time car I take part in a car sharing program. I became a paid member at Instacart at $99 for a year because not having to go and get groceries seemed like an excellent way to cut down on my car usage. I placed an order on 4/2/19, a Tuesday morning and got my items delivered in the afternoon. Instacart automatically authorizes a payment of 10-15% more than the amount to cover any adjustments or ad ones that might occur during shopping. My total came to $144.94 and was adjusted in my bank account from $170 shortly after receiving my groceries to reflect the final charge. However, that was not the final charge, because they ran my card again for another $144.94 that evening. I have been on the phone with my bank to try and stop this payment, I called Instacart to ask what happened, and I wrote about 6 different emails with documentation of the double charges only to be ignored and dismissed. I didn’t get an apology or even an explanation as to why this might have happened, and I am still minus an extra 144.94 from my bank account now 2 days after the order has been placed. I will be canceling my membership and moving on to better routes for groceries, but before that wanted to let others know the dangers of using this company. They could easily leave your bank account in the red with these kinds of mistakes that they won’t even admit to or apologize for.

I've been spending approximately $1200 per month with Instacart. I use services like Instacart so I don't have to deal with the uneducated, brain-dead slow incompetent people who work at grocery stores nowadays. Service across the board has become unbearable over the year. It's sad when one finds out there's no escape from such horrible service! I ordered from Ralph's via Instacart. I edited my order and chose ""Do Not Replace"" for 14 of the 15 items. The moment the shopper began putting together the order, I began getting bombarded with numerous texts regarding the items she replaced. I texted the shopper and told her not to replace the items. I further asked her why she was replacing items when the order specifically states not to replace them. She stated the order did not say that. We ordered Cheese Whiz...I know gross for the celery and crackers. Supposedly Ralph's did not have it (we know they did), so the shopper decided to replace it with Tostitos Cheese Dip. What a brain-dead person! Considering the bad and ignorant behavior of that laborer, we drove to the Ralph's store where she compiled the order and sure enough we found the Cheese Whiz she claimed did not exist. On every single order I place via Instacart, there is a specific instruction on it (saved for all orders) stating ""Intercom Code 051"". The illiterate laborer did not bother getting out of her car and instead told Instacart she could not reach me. I received a text from Instacart stating she was waiting in the front because she could not reach me. I knew this was b.s. This is the standard behavior of lazy, sub-par laborers today. I went to the entrance area and the first thing I did was type 051 on the intercom system and sure enough my cell rang; so in other words, it worked. The entire time, the sub-par laborer was sitting in her car. I signaled her; pretty much letting her know I'm not moving another foot. She was the most ghetto, brain-dead, lazy laborer I've dealt with. I will never use Instacart again. There's no way I'm willing to pay for horrible, unreliable service and there's no way in hell I will support stupidity by using a service that hires such uneducated, ignorant people!Update: I was so angry following this review, I decided to contact Instacart via phone. I was surprised their customer service line was open on Sunday. I wasn't expecting that. I spoke to a rep and explained the situation. I could tell that when she reviewed my account, she knew I was serious seeing that I spend a minimum of $1200/month via Instacart and never complain. The customer service rep was nice and very understanding. Thank God their system saves all texts between the shopper and consumer. She was reviewing the texts and could not believe the ignorant things the shopper was stating to me in the texts. The customer service lady realized how serious of an issue this was and transferred me to their ""upper management tier"". I spoke with another lady in the ""upper tier"". I explained the situation. She was very nice and understanding. What concerned me was the lady telling me she's going to take care of the issue and have management have a talk with the employee. That employee should be fired, not warned! I strongly voiced my opinion to the rep stating that it's unacceptable to allow such behavior to occur. Customer service is an innate common sense based skill. One either has the skill, or they don't!  There's no teaching it! It's obvious that delivery person does not have the skill! The uneducated delivery person is a toxic liability to Instacart. Why in the heck would Instacart hold onto a toxic liability and risk losing an asset (customer)? I voiced such to the rep and further stated that there are many qualified people available to do the job."

It has been great until now.  Today i was home with my grandkids and needed a few things for breakfast so i checked the availability of a delivery for today.  At 6 pm, they gave me an estimate of up to 2 hours. The updated estimated time kept changing.  The final estimated time was 8:30-9:30. At 8:20 I received a call stating the driver's car broke down and would not be able to get my order delivered tonight. My issue is not with the driver.   I am sympathetic to a hard working person who is experiencing problems,  my issue is with Instacart.  They should have back up solutions when issues arise.  I was depending on that delivery to be here tonight.  I was willing to compromise if they could get it delivered by 8AM but they said they could not call a delivery person when they're not on shift. They were only willing to promise delivery between 9-10, which didn't work for me as the rest of the family was coming for breakfast in the morning.   TInstacart was unable or unwilling to correct the issue.  Therefore,  I canceled my order and instead of Publix and Instacart,  I ordered pick up from Walmart for 8AM. Problem solved and I probably won't be using them again until i know they've fixed this issue."

We ended up in Fort Walton Beach in an AirBnB which was a save from a hellish vaca spoiled in Jacksonville. So traveling on Christmas day to the Fort Walton Beach BnB we needed to use InstaCart to get groceries quickly from the local Publix in an area for which we were unfamiliar.We thought InstaCart was an economic lifesaver.  They even advertised there were NO delivery fees, but that was just an outright LIE.  The ""delivery fee"" didn't exist, but something called a ""service charge"" most certainly did (and I doubt there is little difference between the two, except a lexical sleight-of-hand).  So InstaCart's ""service fee"" tacked on an additional 5%, which at almost $400 for a week's worth of groceries or so, was about $20!The $20 ""service fee"" also did not include the crappy shopper's ""tip"" which was also almost $20. So, for $40 in FEES (which pushed the total well over $400!) I would've just gone there myself and done my own shopping, especially since my ""personal"" shopper had to substitute half my grocery list and got most of the substitutions wrong. (They also put you on the spot, texting you substitutions that you're supposed to approve right there and then with little or no chance to vet THEIR choices.  Or they just put it in the cart anyway whether you approve it or not. This, incidentally, was how I ended up with 8 lbs of organic meat that was 90% fat-free and tasted like chewing a leather coat!)  I suppose it's also no surprise then that your ""personal"" shopper will substitute items at a higher cost to increase his tip.When I submitted a complaint to InstaCart arguing that their advertising of a ""free delivery charge"" was a FRAUD, I got the usual scripted answer from ""Customer Service"" probably somewhere in Indonesia or the Philippines, and eventually my complaint just went ignored and was never answered.So, while some might be tempted to chalk this one up to caveat emptor, it's really just a case of out-and-out FRAUD and a slimy sleight-of-hand.  Use InstaCart at your own risk. Like so many things these days -- Ebay, Amazon, etc. -- there really is no such thing as Customer Service and the companies really don't stand behind their promises, or in this case, outright LIE, nor do they really care about your complaints. So, my advice?  Don't use them!  Oh, and tell EVERYBODY about them until they go away!"

I emailed Instacart to complain and at first I was offered a credit for a future trip, which is a tactic to try and get your repeat business.

So she called me to check on everything, and I explained that I am on disability, so my money is very tight and I cannot get the things if Instacart won’t give me the sales. Well the shopper showed up with the items and said that I did get the sale. I had left notes about certain items that if I couldn’t get the sale I didn’t want the items. So she called me to check on everything, and I explained However, when I Got to my email receipt from Instacart  it was the same price $120. Listen to these points:  Instacart does not allow the drivers/shoppers to give you your receipt from the store. They state that it’s not a fair assessment of what the prices are. The Shopper told me that my bill was actually $95.19. I called and spent two hours with different people at Instacart. They refused to credit me the difference, all of them saying that they have different pricing  contracts which all of the stores, and sometimes you cannot get the sale ads, so that is why they don’t want you to see the receipt. Seriously??!! I was told that their price was the one to go by. I kept telling them that the only price that matters is the grocery store receipt, which I had also gotten by email, so the $95 was correct. As it was, I lost about an additional $30-$40 in the other sales that Instacart refused to give me.  they blamed the store saying contracts that my store set up did not allow for sales. SO UNTRUE. I spoke to the manager of my store, and he assured me that any sales that you can get you should be able to get with Instacart !!!! Again, they were telling me that the price from the store doesn’t show things like service fees and delivery fees. I advised that I am and express customer, and I do not have delivery fees or service fees, that the only correct price was the tip for the Shopper. On and on it went, with several of them telling me that there are different things that aren’t shown on the grocery receipt. I said the grocery receipt shows  what the actual charge was, and THAT charge plus the shopper Tip amount should be the only added price. After two hours I gave up, I canceled my membership, and I am contacting the Consumer Fraud Division of the federal government to file a report against Instacart.  I believe that they are actually charging people more money, the price that is on your shopping cart page when you submit it, no matter what your true price is! The Instacart total has a disclaimer which states that the total is only an approximate.  it states that prices may change for your total price based on substitutions, out of sale items, etc.  If I hadn’t been so knowledgeable about the prices I was looking for and what I could afford, and if the amount wasn’t as much,  I might not have known that they had charged me more than what was on the grocery receipt. This company is a sham, considering they say the same thing over and over again, I believe that that is how they are taught to get around the situation. It didn’t work with me and I say to anyone out there , DO NOT USE THEM!!!"

The store which usually sells Bachman brand Air-Popped Butter Popcorn has stopped carrying it for some reason so I searched for alternate ways to get it.  Instacart's website had a photo of the Bachman popcorn so I ordered 10 bags with clear instructions to NOT SUBSTITUTE ANYTHING ELSE.  When the shopper arrived to deliver my 10 bags of Bachman popcorn, he handed me 2 shopping bags, turned, and almost RAN away!  Before he got 2 feet away I looked inside the bags and immediately saw they did NOT CONTAIN WHAT I ORDERED so I called him back saying, ""Hey, where are you going? I didn't order these!""  He kept going.  I said, ""Wait!  Take these back with you - I didn't order these and I don't want them!""  He stopped, turned, and said, ""Take it up with Instacart!""  I said, ""Take these back with you!  I specifically made the notation on my order to NOT SUBSTITUTE ANYTHING!""  He said, ""I don't take things back - I only deliver things.  If you have any problem, tell Instacart, not me.""  So I contacted Instacart and they asked me to send them a photo of what I received.  I took the photo of the stuff, sent it to them, AND HAVEN'T HEARD BACK FROM ANYONE IN OVER A WEEK.  I had to initiate a ""Claim"" with my Credit Card Company and have been still waiting for them to resolve the issue.  I ordered 10 bags of popcorn and got 10 bags of corn chips of a totally unknown name brand.  My Instacart experience was a complete rip off and a nightmare!  Of course, if your shopper found exactly what you ordered and you got it, you should have no complaints but as soon as you order something that they can NOT find, they don't care that you indicated NO SUBSTITUTIONS - if they honored that, they wouldn't have been able to make the sale.  They'd rather ignore their own ""No Substitutions"" box and send anything before admitting they could not fulfill your order.  Not even my credit card company has been able to get through to them!  They have a way of ignoring all contact attempts that may result in a refund.  I can't even find a phone number for them as they ignore all email requests for attention and refund.  These 10 bags of corn chips are sitting on my floor for 2 weeks now, waiting for someone to come pick them up.  Do yourself a favor and find a more reputable shopping service."

I was referred by a friend with a $20 off AND free delivery coupon code. The coupon was applied but wasn’t reflecting in the bill, so I called Instacart support. The lady told me to place the order to see if it would show up. Then when it didn’t show up, she checked with her supervisor and said there’s a new rule she was unaware of - I have to spend $35 or more for the coupon to work. It would have been nice to know that either on the coupon itself or from the Instacart employee who should know her business. She told me to cancel the order and place another one and wait a couple days for the money to be pulled from my bank, maybe it just takes processing time. I did another order for $35 and waited but nothing was applied and the order ended up over $50 after delivery and taxes. I called again and was told that I would be refunded the $20 but not the delivery because free delivery only counts on the first order. I explained that the only reason my first order was cancelled was because I was TOLD to cancel it by Instacart themselves. The man said his supervisor would have to investigate it and that I should receive an email about what’s going on. I had planned on sending a picture I took of the initial coupon to prove it had FREE DELIVERY. I received no email or call after 2 days so I called again. A lady told me there was something on my account and she was surprised I hadn’t been contacted yet. She said she was sure I’d get a response soon. A week and a half later I finally call again and FINALLY they say I can get refunded the delivery fee, only to be told then that it had been so long since the order that they are unable to refund me the delivery fee. It’s INSTACART’s fault that it took so long. They offered me a credit on my account but why would I ever place another order with this company? I left a review on my order and was reached out to be an Instacart employee, and I explained to him the situation. He told me that free delivery only applies to the first order which I already knew. The problem was my first order didn't get any of the coupon applied which is the company's fault. It's like he didn't even read what I said. He passed me off to yet ANOTHER Instacart employee who asked me to detail what happened. I again had to explain the entire situation, and she told me she had applied a free delivery credit on my account but that I'd have to spend $35 for it to work. I told her I didn't want a credit as I had stated before, especially since I've had such a bad experience. I said I would be reporting this to the BBB. After an entire week yet ANOTHER Instacart employee reached out just to say that I was already refunded the $20 for the $20 off portion of the coupon. I already knew that! I'm trying to get the money back for the delivery that was supposed to be FREE. They also tried calling me, but since it was a number I didn't know I of course didn't answer. Instead of leaving a voicemail, they called 4 times and left no messages and mentioned nothing about it via email. They called 4 times back-to-back and I had to keep ignoring the calls because I was at work. Very unprofessional."

I placed an order for a thanksgiving meal through sprouts.com. chose placed and pay! We were waiting for the food only to learn that even if you pay it is not guaranteed you’ll receive your meal. Apparently sprouts stores have been sold out of these meals for about a week and noone bothered to let the customer’s know but they will gladly take your money and make you wait. Not only do you pay for the meal itself but they add extra charges for “just incase we dont have it and need to substitute” I called every sprouts store in the area and they all said they do not have access to instacart and that they are not directly connected. I called insta cart and they give you the runaround how sorry they are. And apparently i wasnt the only one calling about this there were a few other people complaining about the same situation. So if youre going to order a holiday meal from sprouts or vons/safeway or any other place that hires this company dont order online call instead because you will be greatly disappointed paying for something and not receiving it and not even knowing it until the day of the event.

I ask ""how do I know that I will get the correct items?"".  In the midst of her stammering response the driver calls.  I click over.  He yells at me that he can't get to my house because the road is blocked. I tell him HOW to get to my house and he yells again saying that he knows how to come there is too much traffic! My response was ""oh so you CAN get here, you don't want to because there is traffic""!!...This is draining me and as I am thinking how much I regret this whole decision he yells and I mean YELLS I need to find another way to get the food. I just click over and tell the customer service person I don't know what type of operation you all have, but the shopper didn't get it right, the driver is calling and being very disrespectful, for all of this I should have taken my Mommy-tired self to the store and done the task that they advertised  help with MYSELF!!!In short (lol)...If you want something done correctly...do it yourself!!!"

People view this as a great way to make extra money? I am pretty confident in my assessment that the majority, if not all, making any statement like that either work directly for Instacart marketing, or don't consider the actual costs of doing the shopping and delivery.Instacart forces you to either supply your own insulated bags, fair enough, or you cannot deliver. You can, however, purchase four insulated bags direct from instacart. strange thing is Instacart will allow you to use whatever you have until you receive their insulated bags?  so you can use whatever bags you have for ten days, but you cannot deliver with whatever bags you have to begin with?Problems with the application approval process The worst part for me was the ongoing back and forth of waiting for my application to be approved, they sent an Instacart Card, and Instacart Visa charge card, I was ready to begin..I was able to select hours..Everything was fine, until it wasn't and no real explanation for the delay.

However it's become dismal and a recent series of mishaps has me so infuriated I've vowed never to use it again and will stick with Shipt. Aside from a growing number of specific item issues where something isn't in stock and strange substitutions, small forgotten items, then not being notified of substitutions until the shopper closed the order, then about 2 weeks ago, There was $150 worth of groceries left at the wrong door, then on the very next order, it took 3 tries and multiple angry emails with support and 2 phone calls to get a bag of dog food I ordered that was left out of my delivery. They were insisting on giving me a credit on my next order, but I told them there would be no next order and I wanted what I paid for at no extra cost to me. Here's the deal- I paid a %5 service charge on that $15 bag of food. The credit would have only been for the item plus tax (per support). I was told the service charge was what they use to ""provide me with the best possible service and it was nonrefundable"". Really? So if I order it again, I would pay that charge a second time on the subtotal before credits are applied, even though I only received it once. I opted for redelivery. Then the following day after making myself available for that delivery, someone came with an order- it wasn't mine. It was anything but one bag of food I was supposed to get. She was on the phone rooting through her car for awhile, then just left and the redelivery was cancelled without notice. I had to call, again, and demand, again, that they redeliver my food at no charge. I did not want a credit on a future order. So I pay more for them to mess up an order. Furthermore, because the food is only $15, I can't order it by itself without a $10 service charge, so I'd be forced to order another $20 in items in order to avoid that. So in short, mistakes are incentivized by tethering customers to make future orders and pay further service fees and tips. All to get what you paid for today. I had to speak to about 6-8 different support team members to demand they bring the food, by itself, with no cost to me. And this after they inflated their fees and yearly membership by %50 and 5% on all orders. To add a little salt in that wound, the service personnel I've dealt with were rude, accusatory, fail to understand math, give nothing more than a script without hearing your problem, make correction of those problems difficult, and if you go online they blame customers for being disgruntled and accuse clientele of complaining only to get free stuff. What I really want is a pro-rated refund of my annual membership fee. Not asking for anything I didn't pay for, I just want out. Service is dismal from what it was when allegedly they raised fees to improve the quality. Not so, Instacart."

I’ve used Instacart on many occasions and they had been helpful when I order heavy items I, myself, would have great difficulty carrying up the stairs to my condo. The past several times though, service had failed for multiple reasons. For instance, I ordered basic stuff like bottled water, bread, milk, etc. I use the feature that tells the shopper if they don’t have a particular brand, that it’s ok to replace with any alternative brands. Only to have a shopper refund that item, because they didn’t have any in stock. (Really??? The store is completely out of milk and bottled water??)I started to realize that now shoppers conveniently “can’t locate” the heavier items I order because I’m sure they don’t want to deal with carrying them up my stairs either. One time, I ordered, and they just left my delivery dumped in front of my downstairs neighbors yard with no communication about where my delivery was. I had to spend time calling customer service to have them track down the shopper to find out when and where he delivered my purchases. Another issue, is one time a shopper accidentally left the receipt in the bag of groceries delivered and I saw the total cost of the purchase was about $50 less than what I was charged. When I called to inquire about this price difference they told me that Instacart gets charged by the grocery store to shop there, which is why I pay more than what the receipt states. (Seriously doubt this)Instacart is just getting shadier and way less reliable and I will not deal with them any more."

Well, when it was delivered, I only received 12 of the 25 items i ordered. I called Instacart wondering why I didnt receive the replacement items?? CS said that as ""a shopper it can be stressful to try and get your order done fast so they probably dont look at your change requests. If you really want them to replace an item, you should message them and tell them."" Where in their app does it say ""Even though we have this item replacement feature, if you REALLY want a replacement item, you will have to message your shopper""???

Below is a copy and paste of a few of his Instacart indictments in only the last 2 years, which is all being bankrolled by too many ""too big to fail"" financial bail out firms to count.In March 2017, Instacart agreed to pay a $4.6 million class action settlement stemming from the misclassification of its shopper employees as independent contractors. The suit alleged 18 violations, including improper tip pooling and failure to reimburse workers for business expenses.[27] Instacart has also faced intense criticism from its workers and tech media for removing the option of its customers to tip their shopper in November 2016. Backlash against the policy forced the company to reinstate the tipping option only weeks later.[28] In November 2017, a large number of Instacart workers participated in a strike against the company, alleging wages as low as $1 an hour. Instacart claimed that the strike had no impact on its operations.[29] In February 2018, Instacart mistakenly withheld tips given from it's customers to shoppers, and blamed a ""bug."" Customers who also waived the service fee were often still charged.[30] In April 2018, Instacart instituted a controversial non-waiveable 5% service fee on all orders.[31]"

Don't do it. Shop Kroger via clicklist instead. I do not work for clicklist, but I will shamelessly promote a great service when I see a competitor enter the market with all around subpar service. REVIEW: At first it seemed like a great idea. Especially if you are going through any physical or health hardships like I was. But it is highway robbery. Not worth it in the long run. I was able to avoid grocery shopping for a year without a major blow to my budget by piece-mealing amazon prime now and clicklist through Kroger. I'm no longer in an area serviced by prime now OR clicklist delivery. Just instacart. As it is prices are marked up, as to be expected. But Between the service fee AND delivery fee, you may already be paying about 15-20% of your order. Then they take out a small tip, which the drivers expect for you to increase to 15-20%. After all that, you should expect to be paying around 25% of your order in service charges and tip. I paid $30 once for a $120 order.   I heard from one of the shoppers once that they were only getting paid $4 for an order I placed for $100 for which Instacart was already charging me $8 in fees. They have the nerve to charge $150 for a yearly subscription. I dont pay that for amazon. And they definitely are NOT amazon. Get it together first. Not to mention they change the interface often without notifying customers. Where you go one week to tip will not be the same the next week. The app, unlike clicklist, does not keep up with what's truly in stock in the store so you could be selecting things that they never have. And their substitution selections they suggest to their shoppers aren't actual substitutions by any other shopping apps standards. They will sub you a different product under the same brand rather than same product different brand. And the shoppers tell me that's what the app suggested. Like for real??  And you can forget about a price match for a different brand like click list does. They will give you a $10 5 oz bottle of olive oil when you shopped for a $10 18 oz bottle as a 'substitute'. Who wants to pay that? The only way to cancel the substitution is to catch them while they're shopping, which they do at the speed of light, because there is a lot of pressure for shoppers to be fast I hear. Besides, if you had time or bandwidth to babysit the shoppers you'd probably just do the shopping yourself. Just skip it and shop yourself. This is workforce slavery and rape to any customers pockets for sub-par service."

As a senior citizen who suffers from chronic asthma, a grocery delivery service at this time seemed to be a godsend, but this experience has proven to be more hellish than necessary. Our Costco groceries totalled $343.10 but our InstaCart Bill was $452.40 for a difference of over $109.00.

I gave one star even though the delivery driver did his job well because I feel robbed by this company!

NEVER, EVER again!

Customer Service;Pricing;Shopper Issues;Wrong Product;,https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1295,san R.,1.0 star rating,Unethical and Horrible practices to cheat customers by instacart company and shoppers,"								Terrible company and shoppers, I have very bad experience not just once but 4 times, today I got a small toilet paper roll delivered when I ordered for a large pk of paper towels for 28.99. How can anyone with brain make such poor choices unless their intent is to cheat, after spending 4 hours with various support people without refund I am better off campaigning to banish this unethical company from America

Customer Service;Pricing;Shopper Issues;Wrong Product;,https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1107,Nancy F.,1.0 star rating,Read these reviews!,"								I agree with the other low raters here! I tried Instacart today for the first time, and it was definitely a bad experience! The shopper woman made several mistakes, charged me too much, and now I have to wait up to 7 days for my adjustment from the $170 the co. Automatically charges to get started. Scary to think I won't be getting this refund because of everything else negative from today! NEVER AGAIN!

Pricing;Shopper Issues;Wrong Product;,https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1044,Gary E.,1.0 star rating,Scammed Twice,"								I've ""tried' to use instacart during this virus epidemic to keep my family safe. First time they delivered
To wrong address and told me tough. Fortunately, I found the address and was able to get the order.
Second time, they only delivered 1/2 the order yet charged me for the full order and will not respond or
Reply. I've forwarded case to Police and Sheriff's Office for prosecution. This is fraud by means of interstate
Commerce folks. A federal felony.

Customer Service;Shopper Issues;Wrong Product;,https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1068,Jamie T.,1.0 star rating,Gone down steeply,"								I've been using the service for a couple of years, and would generally give 4 stars. However, the service has slipped to zero in the past couple of weeks. They've been busy i. E. making more money, but new hires are not being trained properly, there is no customer service by phone or online and I don't know if the site has crashed. This is new. I've been trying to follow up a complaint about wrong items delivered on April 1. Here it is April 6 and I still can not get anyone to straighten it out. Really, really bad.

Customer Service;Shopper Issues;Wrong Product;,https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1136,M S.,1.0 star rating,Bad customer service,"								Driver delivered to wrong address. No follow up from driver or instacart in the past 48 hours of my consistent reaching out. Could have been solved simply by returning and redelivering to correct address. Driver was aware of mistake within after his departure. Instacart's lack of ownership of the issue has led the elderly waiting another week for their grocery delivering during this worldwide pandemic.

Customer Service;Shopper Issues;Wrong Product;,https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1146,samuel k.,1.0 star rating,Instacart delivered grocery to wrong address,"								Instacart shopper delivered to wrong address. I live in house. Text message showed he dropped off apartment 12. Why? Our address is 1012. He assumed last 12 is apartment number and went incorrect address and could not find right address-- rather than dragging grocery; he dropped off grocery to the stranger.
Attached picture is not my house's front porch. I complained to the website link; but no response for 7 days.
I called credit card to file a dispute claim. What a irresponsible company!
Make sure you use credit card if you have to use this company-- no paypal or venmo -- just in case.

Pricing;Shopper Issues;Wrong Product;,https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#893,Debbie Q.,1.0 star rating,"Double charged my credit card, & charged for items did not recieve","								1st mistake, Instacart is a third party, not affiliated with local grocery stores. Instagram double charged my credit card $210.00 for $83.00 actually spent. And I had 1 item missing that they charged me for. I ordered 43 items and they only delivered 20 items. Their prices they charge consumer are outrageous. They home up prices the actual sore prices are lower. What crooks! I will not use instacart again.

Shopper Issues;Cancellation;Theft;Wrong Product;,https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1585,S K.,1.0 star rating,Don't use this service,"								I have used Instacart about 6 times and it is never a good experience. First, they put an estimated hold on your account even when you cancel an order. Secondly, it is so hit or miss - mostly miss about what you get. I just received ordered 12 things, three they just canceled, 2 they replaced with something else, and 4 they brought the wrong items. So of what I ordered only 3 were correct. I can't call anyone and this terrible. Last time I use them.

Shopper Issues;Pricing;Theft;Wrong Product;,https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1197,Sharon M.,1.0 star rating,Price Gouging or Highway Robbery?,"								We ordered groceries from Costco for delivery using InstaCart in Powder Springs GA. The markup on each item was outrageous. The shopper needlessly substituted cheaper/lesser products but the price difference was not reflected in my final bill. Example: We ordered chicken breasts and received chicken thigh meat. The package price was $15.24 but InstaCart price was $37.60, a difference of over $22.00. We notified them through their order/issue option 5 days ago but have not heard anything from them other than an acknowledgement of receipt. We will never use them again and would not recommend them to anyone!
