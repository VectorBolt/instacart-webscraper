After lugging 6 boxes filled with items downhill and up flights of stairs for a $134 tip the customer removed the tip amount claiming all items were damaged and accused me of stealing a comforter that wasn’t even on the receipt. The customer did not offer photo proof and Instacart has no shopper support. The order was for $161 total for 90 items from Costco. I walked away with $34 for the entire order after the customer removed their tip. Instacart is a scam!!!

Shopper took 2 1/2 hours to pick out three simple items at the store. 30 seconds after he marked it as check out complete and en route, he marked it as delivered but my groceries were nowhere to be found and I live 25 minutes from the store so there’s no way he could’ve made it there in 30 seconds. The proof of delivery photo was just a black square. Guessing he stole my groceries now I’m left with nothing to eat for dinner because the store is now closed. First and last time using instacart."

I get it, it happens and the shoppers probably have multiple orders they shop for. However, I placed an order for 8 items at Publix (Florida grocery store) that totaled $54.34. I see 3 different things added to my order that I DEFINITELY DID NOT add. The problem with these is the 3 of them combined cost $141.97. SO NOW my order totaled at $196.31. I took a screen shot of the added items and reached out to Erik (my shopper). I said why were these added I did not add these. His response ""Yes"".... So, my next message was ""I want the receipt for my order when you drop off the groceries""... Next notification I received seconds after that message to him was ""your order has been delivered"". I was literally standing out front in my driveway when that notification came through.I called customer service. BOY are they a joke. They answered, apologized and they said they would issue a full refund for my order and it would be deposited in 5-10 business days. I don't think it is fair I have to wait 5-10 business days for their shopper stealing from a customer and racking up the bill more than twice the amount I originally planned on spending and esp before Christmas. I still have Christmas presents to purchase, which this now sets me back a little. So, moving forward. I told the customer service representative I would like to take more action and calling the cops. The customer service rep kept repeating himself saying Instacart is handling it. So, if anything legal happens they don't give you any information whatsoever if you decide to escalate the situation to local authorities. I asked what their policy was regarding legalities. The customer service rep had no idea. Instacart is a multimillion possible multibillion dollar corporation with no policies regarding legalities. They just keep saying ""Instacart is taking care of it"". This raises concerns, esp if something drastic did ever happen. What if this shopper comes to my house (since he knows my address now) because I reported him and retaliates against me? What then? What happens at that point (god forbid it happens)? Instacart has no company policy in this regard. I now have to keep an eye on my bank account and hope they do in fact refund my money their shopper stole from me. I really do not recommend Instacart. I know it is convenient when you don't have the time to shop but when something like this happens it truly is not worth it. I run 2 successful shops on Etsy, when I issue a refund to a customer the money is deposited within 24-48 hours. I know Instacart can in fact have the money deposited quicker. They just choose not to."

WHAT THE HECK!?!?!?!?! I would have to pay more in delivery fees, service fees (YES, THEY HAVE MULTIPLE FEE CATEGORIES) and tips than the cost of the items, and would have to go through the same crap experience, to me this amounts to EXTORTION or STEALING. They charged me for items I didn't get, and now won't return the money unless I spend more with them. They take too many orders then blame high volume for poor customer service. I would happily pick a delivery window for a following day rather then get garbage service. Taking my money for a service you are too overbooked to provide is not ethical.If you contact them about multiple issues (in my case expensive items that I was charged for but never received and fresh vegetables waaayyy beyond the questionable stage - they were literally dissolving into disgusting goo) they will take several days to only address the first issue.A while back I tried using them to get my mother some groceries in another city, items were never delivered although they claim they were and we were charged and had to fight over a refund. She has a doorbell camera (so we have proof they didn't arrive) and an easy to identify/find apartment and we get deliveries from restaurants and such without issues all the time. I've tried using the app several times over the last year, thinking that perhaps they just needed time to adjust to the larger volume of Covid orders and I didn't want to give up on them in the middle of a crisis. But nothing is improving, if anything customer service is going downhill. I've been having much better luck with AMAZON FRESH and will use them exclusively for deliveries from now on. Highly recommend them. If you have an Amazon Prime Membership there are no delivery fees as well, WIN WIN!"

I was cheated in my supplies the first time. It was of poor quality and less Quantity. Next time I bought an electronic scale and checked. There was no need to check. the robbery was so evident. one Papaya was 2.8 Kg and an orange 1/2 Kg. Everything was not according to weight charged. When I reported to instacart, with a chart of charged weight and actual weight. I got a reply that intacart is refunding the short-changed/short supplied price difference. Nobody had the courtesy to explain daylight robbery. It is like if you catch a thief, instead of going to jail he agrees to return stolen goods but charges you for his time and effort in conducting the robbery. (like the fee and tip Charged) I checked their service only twice but they charged me C$112.00 yearly fee there is no reunfd option. I don't remember becoming or applying for membership.So the  supplies of around $100 has cost me about $130 in delivery charges. Plus time and and aggravation."

I have ordered from the company before.  They have delivered to the wrong address or given me the wrong item (cabbage instead of lettuce, etc.)  This time takes the cake.  My order from Costco was delivered 1 hour after it was promised.  I received one item out of 7.  Where did the other items go?  Where was my shopper?  The one item was delivered by a random delivery person.  Instacart has the potential to do great things.  Hire good people and train them.  It's not that difficult.  You have lost a customer."

He was able to accept my delivery order, have access to my card, and he pretended to shop for my groceries.  I say pretend because somehow, he shopped a large order in under 10 minutes, got all items no substitutions, and added $150 to my order under an item called “Prim”He then checked out and delivery was pending.  When I seen my $250 order was now over $400 I reached out to him and he switched my delivery to delivered.  I called instacart, and at first they wanted to tell him to return the “prim” and bring me my groceries.  I told them he doesn’t have them, he faked the whole thing, and he’s just straight up stealing $400.  I also told them I would never be ok with this man coming to my home, and I wanted a full refund.  They eventually cancelled my order and black listed him, but my refund won’t show up for 5-10 days.  That’s all the money I had and now I’m broke with no groceries.   Let me repeat: a man posed as a woman and pretended to shop, added $150 in items I didn’t request, and then when I asked him what the charge was for, he switched my order to “delivered” and made off with $400 of my money, which won’t be refunded for 5-10 days."

Nothing ever is done 100% correctly, shoppers are constantly lazy and lie straight to your face, and frequently steal items.And customer service? A fūckíng joke. Good luck getting them to get their thumbs out of their asses to do ANYTHING within a week. God forbid you need a refund, you probably won't get it for two weeks. IF they actually bother to refund you in the first place, that is.I have wasted WEEKS of my time on their bullshíť, calling them, chatting, listening to two agents argue in broken English in the same call. They do NOT give a single flying fųck about the customer, they scam you by marking up EVERYTHING, and refuse to honor in-store sales. I've also had their own shoppers mark up more on my order without my permission. Don't EVER subject yourself to the protracted torture of trying to use Instacart.It'd be less painful, and faster, to just set yourself on fųckíng fire."

They were unable to find many items (eg celery) and substituted many others with more expensive items. My shopper replaced a 12ib turkey with a 22lb turkey without asking me. When I noticed it and told her it was too large and I don’t want anything larger than 15lbs, she indicated she would not include it. She didn’t include it but still charged me $50 for it on the order. In trying to get a refund, one agent responded they were sorry I wasn’t available to receive my order and then asked when I would be available for redelivery. I responded tgst I wanted a refund and the next agent asked if I wanted a refund or credit to my Instacart account. Again I indicated I wanted a refund. The next agent I was directed to told me they understood my frustration but they couldn’t give me a refund because the order was more than 90 days old. After all the back and forth, it’s now a week old but clearly not 90 days old. This isn’t my first issue with Instacart. There hasn’t been a single order where they found the majority of items on my order often unable to find staples like bread despite the fact that there must be many acceptable substitutes. My experience with customer service has been horrendous."

In using it about 6 times, I had good experiences until this past weekend.  I ordered a 45 oz tub of Smart Balance Butter and was charged $6.99.  I received a 15 oz tub instead-so was overcharged $3.00.  I reported the problem 5 TIMES over the course of 2 days.  I even went to the store and got a detailed receipt that showed the store received the correct amount of money for the smaller item-but my credit card was charged incorrectly.  There is no way to get in direct contact with them-the store manager told me of the ""ins and outs"" of how they have to deal with them and he didn't have anything positive to say.  I brought the smaller tub of butter and asked if I could exchange it right there but because of the rules with Instacart, he wouldn't let me.  I had my emailed receipt to prove I had been charged for the larger one, but to no avail.So, the only thing I would suggest is doing a full inventory with the shopper when they deliver-and if there is a mistake, you can try and work with that individual, hoping they will do the right thing.  The $3.00 isn't the issue-it's the fact the company hasn't responded or even acknowledged my issue after submitting 5 complaints."

I have been in contact with customer care via both email and phone and I’ve spent countless hours trying to resolve this to no avail. I’m now out approximately $500 for absolutely nothing thanks to Instacart. In fact, I requested a refund for my express membership due to this horrible experience, and they just canceled me.

So far, it's been an okay experience. Why I stuck to using it for this long is because I work 2 jobs. You do get stuck with some unprofessional shoppers who do a sloppy job at handling your groceries and not being careful with the fragile items (ex: eggs and bread). I wish there was a quick option where you can avoid a shopper you don't want for future orders. The only way you can do that is to call instacart's customer service to have them block that shopper directly. I dislike the tip system, how it automatically gives the shopper 5% of the total amount of your final purchase. Especially since you don't know if that shopper will handle your groceries with care. I believe they should have that option AFTER they are done delivering the groceries. Now, why I have decided to stop using instacart for good: The last purchase I made, the shopper had already paid for the groceries. But I noticed that at the very bottom of the grocery list, there was an item added to my card that said ""error"". It showed an amount of x2 for $75. So I was also being charged for this ""error"" along with my groceries. As I was trying to figure out why it was on the list, I received a text message stating that my order was rescheduled for the next day at 6:30 am, even though the website was already telling me that the shopper was in transit to bring me the groceries.I called the instacart customer service because I checked my bank to see that I had been charged for the original amount of my purchase of $150, on top of the $180 that I believe is from the ""error"", even though they rescheduled my order. The lady told me that there was an outage in the store. Which didn't make sense to me because the shopper didn't have any problem checking out and charging my card. She was already on her way to dropping off the groceries. It took customer service a while to really figure out what the problem was. I didn't feel comfortable with how the situation was handled, because all I was told was that she was going to leave a note for the next day that the order was going to be shopped, for the extra amount that I was charged (the ""error"" of $180) to be refunded to me. I told her I want to cancel my order and I also want to leave a bad review and block the shopper in charge of my order. The shopper never notified me about any 'outage' in the store, nor did she notify me that she won't be able to deliver the groceries. She also failed to mention anything about the ""error"" charge of x2 $75. There was no communication between the shopper and myself. By the time I wanted to contact her to see what was going on, the order had been rescheduled to the next day, and I had no way of contacting her.I did get my refund, but that was before I was charged from instacart for 3 separate payments. I still don't understand how it happened, but I was charged $150 for my original order, $180 for no reason apparently, and then another $150 the next day when the order has been cancelled. It seems that there was a mistake, and they assumed that I was still going to carry out my order.Because of this incident, I had to go without a week of food. I had to wait for the money to transfer back to my bank. My family ended up having to eat at my mom's in the meantime.Long story short, that is one of the worst experiences I had with instacart. I will not be using this app or any other online shopping site from now on."

First time the groceries reaked of smoke. Clearly the driver had been smoking with all of my groceries in the car. For someone with asthma who cannot tolerate smoke, this was rather disappointing. This time the customer service was good. I was offered a full refund for my groceries which I declined. The second time I ordered my groceries at 8:00am and they did not get dropped off until 4:30pm. I bought $20 worth of Halloween candy which was stolen. I contacted the driver thinking he had just forgot about it and there was no response. When I contacted the company they wanted to credit my account for less than the value of the candy. I said I would prefer a refund, which I guess takes 5-10 days. There seemed to be no concern at all that the driver was stealing groceries. The customer service representative also gave a very generic response that never even identified my situation."

Called customer care only to be told I needed to email them with proof that I had cancelled. Thankfully I had taken a screenshot of the cancellation and was able to email that to them. Received a canned response advising that they had cancelled my membership, were sorry to see me go  and should see a refund in 5-10 business days. Frustrating to say the least as I had cancelled my membership days prior. Several emails back and forth and got no real apology for basically stealing money from me  and no solution other than wait 5-10 business days for your refund. This company is dishonest, misleading and does not care about its customers. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR CREDIT CARD INFO as they apparently can charge you at will even if you cancel within the allowed time period."

This was what I believed their ""service"" fee was for the convenience of delivery.  (Though they advertise free delivery) when I noticed the almost twenty dollar difference between The paper store receipt and the emailed receipt I contacted customer service and was told this was just a charge for the convenience of using their service. I don't know about you but I consider that stealing since this is not made clear while you're shopping with them.

They have also fixed the star rating. However, they are still blocking MY personal website access to tip adjustment, star rating, and ability to report any problems or issues, and instead, they are choosing to be non-accountable!! Also, very traumatizing, tormenting, infuriating, and inflammatory at every turn and every with phone conversations and instant chat all-day and all night today!) Also, several Instacart support team members put on a one-month free trial membership on my account AGAINST my wishes; however, they swear that they didn't include automatic renewal, and swear that I will not be charged after the one-month free trial membership expiration! Several members REFUSED to totally remove the free trial membership AGAINST my wishes!!!!!The very next day after writing this review (above), I found out that they never deducted my tip from the total showing on my debit card through online banking, although they promised it just yesterday! Then, on top of everything else, they have now additionally blocked my website access to be to do instant chat with any of their Instacart support team members and also the phone number missing that I called them on just yesterday! The only thing showing was a phone number for senior citizens, which I am not a senior citizen, which was offensive and insultive! The only way I could reach them today was by the phone number I still had programmed in my phone from yesterday! Then, even though they refunded me the stolen amount from the personal shopper yesterday, now today, not only did I have to call to have them take the tip off of the total amount showing on online banking, but now told I have to wait 5-10 business days! On top of the entire fiasco already described above yesterday, now I had all this today, and on top of all that, they actually had a rooster sound going off constantly in the background, for further aggravation!nstacart has now also stolen from me!

However thanks to the rating system, even if your overall rating is a 9/10 they leave you with the worst batches dozens of miles away meanwhile the new shoppers gets the best batches since their rating is considered a 10/10 even though they never delivered or been rated. That’s why alot of batches been stolen lately or the orders been delivered late. Goodjob instacart, you failed for not caring about your experienced shoppers.

I placed a $975 grocery order with Publix which said it would be delivered within five hours. I spent approximately two hours placing the order and then another seven hours going back-and-forth with someone who was texting me about items that were out of stock and substitution options avail which I appreciate the fact that they were notifying me of what items were out of stock however it would’ve been much faster for me to go to the store myself. I literally Wasted my entire first day of vacation with my 12 best friends dealing with this order. Then the items were delivered to our vacation rental without any type of notification two hours later than they were supposed to be delivered and left on the hot porch in the 96° Florida sun and most of the items went bad on top of the fact that the meat they delivered us was either already expired or about to expire that day or the next day. They delivered chicken that was green and corn that was rotten etc. Many items were left off of our order Including steaks, they sent the wrong solo cups, they omitted sugar for my order and substituted ground chicken for ground turkey without asking and sent us two jars of spaghetti sauce instead of the four that we had ordered and so many other things. I contacted them immediately and their solution was to deliver the missing items to us the next day by 10 AM. If I needed the items the next day I would’ve placed an order for that day. This ruined our plans for cooking dinner for the evening. Then the next day the order that was supposed to be delivered at 10 AM got changed to 11 AM and then I got a text message that they couldn’t deliver it until after 1 PM and I wasn’t going to sit at the house all day waiting for this order on my vacation. I spent over 30 minutes on the phone with customer service. they said that they only have one delivery person available in the area and that the only option was for them to come after 1 PM or for them to give me a partial credit on my account. I asked them to refund my account for the missing items and after much arguing and rudeness from the customer service agent they said they would but they never did and it has been 9 days. I asked to speak to a manager and they refused. They charged me a $44 delivery fee and $44 tip for a total of $88 and they refuse to refund that amount even though I had to spend two hours placing the order, seven hours back-and-forth texting regarding substitutions, an hour or so at least on the phone the next day dealing with this and then I had to spend two hours driving to the store in traffic and returning the rotten meat and then replace the items that were omitted or exchanging the wrong ones that were received. I could have saved myself a lot of time and money and gone to the store myself in the first place. Lesson learned. I will never ever use this service again! it was my first experience and it was a terrible one. This company is a complete waste of time and money. Do not deal with them."

The software part of Instacart was lovely. Nice interface, great store selection, very easy to fill the cart, and select a delivery time.And then the shopping started. The first text my daughter received from her shopper seemed to be system generated and it alerted her to the fact that the shopper was in the store. That was a nice touch. The second text was a random picture from the shopper placing some zucchini in the cart. Okay, would have been more impressed had she ordered zucchini but the personal touch was ""nice."" Then my daughter received a stream of additional texts--based on the number of substitutions required we began to wonder if the shopper was in the right store. And the products that they were suggesting as substitutions made me question whether the shopper had ever actually shopped in a grocery store before or functioned as an adult within our society. The delivery itself went fine. My daughter got about half the items she had ordered (at one point she just started canceling items instead of trying to explain why the recommended substitutions were not quite right). So I guess she can get to work on disinfecting her room with the can of Pledge wood polish they gave her instead of the requested multi-purpose cleaner, and then she can look into using Amazon Fresh."

However, Instacart still tried to charge me a $3.99 delivery fee for not delivering anything as the order was cancelled in full. Trtying to communicate with these instacart people is like talking to a wall. I finally, after 1 hour, managed to get through to a somewhat lucid person who said they had no way of reversing a delivery fee, regardless of non delivery. Ridiculous yes. It wasn't until I told them I would never use their service again and I did not want a 3.99 credit for a non delivery that they put me with a supervisor who supposedly credited my credit card back the full amount. We'll see and I'll report status later. But I highly recommend that your careful shopping through Instacart. Make sure you either OK replacements or cancel the order if nothing is available, otherwise you'll get charged a delivery fee for no delivery. I'd also be wary of the Shop N Save stores as they had NONE of my ordered items available, thus the cancellation of an entire order, 1 hour wasted ordering non existent items and another 1 1/2 hours dealing with people at instacart who do not communicate very well at all.

Cranapple juice = Cranberry juice, Large oatmeal creme cookies = small oatmeal cookies. This is just 3 out of the 8 things substituted that were not authorized. Then to top it off, she left put my groceries on the porch on an 82 degree day and didn't tell me they were there. I discovered them when I decided to open the wood door at the beginning of my delivery time slot so I could see when she arrived. By the time I discovered the groceries, my ice cream was absolutely liquid, several of the frozen items were half thawed, the milk was cool to the touch, the fresh meat was ambient temperature. Five percent of my order was required to give as a tip (20.00). I have food I cannot use and food that was not able to be used because of damage with the heat and must replaced. The estimated cost of replacement, $85.00. I called Kroger to complain. They did not tell me instacart was responsible but gave me $30.00 on my card to help with replacement cost. I did find out instacart was doing the delivery when I called the Kroger location itself. I then called instacart to complain. The instacart representative said she could pass on my comments but was not very upset or seemingly surprised by my telling of the tale how my groceries were damaged. Here's the jab. I have a compromised immune system thereby prompting me to use delivery instead of going to the store myself. I am also on a fixed income and do not own a car. Had I known the exceptional service I receive at Kroger's Clicklist was not going to transfer to delivery and I would have to spend extra time and money to donate food I can't use and buy again, I would NEVER have used Kroger delivery.

The shoppers are inattentive and often fail to deliver what is requested because they do not adequately read the labels and ensure that they select the correct item. Without fail, multiple items will be unavailable/out of stock and when you request a substitution they will select a replacement that I did not authorize. I have received items that have been either damaged in the store or in transit. The help desk is not helpful and they have representatives that are unable to communicate effectively via telephone. If there is a problem with the charges pending upon your payment mechanism it can take an excessive number of business days to get sorted and until then the charges applied can lock up your banking account.Were there another delivery service that actually provided better service, I would switch in an instant.I cannot, in good conscience, recommend Instacart to anyone."

Bad Food Choices;Delivery Issues;Pricing;Shopper Issues;Customer Service;Theft;Wrong Product;,https://ca.trustpilot.com/reviews/5f259da41a5a690a041d5dd6,SP,1 star: Bad,If I could give it no stars I would.,"If I could give it no stars I would.I have a medically fragile person in my home who requires 24/7 care, has lots of Drs appts, and we are amidst a pandemic. It’s unsafe to shop in public even if I had the free time to, so we’ve had to depend on Instacart to keep my family safer.First off, the customer service is deplorable. If you report a problem, you don't get a reply for days, but they have no problem sending ‘bot mail’ to rate the missing reply...which ends up being a dead end. There are significant systemic issues with communication and order accuracy that are unrelated to out of stock items.It’s been 2 weeks since the last issue with no resolution or refund for over $100 in spoiled food due to errors with delivery timing and location which were clearly stated when the orders were placed.Problem # 1 is you can’t get a real person: you have to go through a maze I’d dead end faq’s and chat bots that don’t address the issue and take longer than the ordering process to navigate.  Then you get to an actual email address...or you can wait on the phone till you have to hang up and get back to life.Email provides a trail, but each exchange is with a different rep who keeps asking for details already provided earlier in the same thread...when they already have electronic access.  In other words, they’re asking us to do their jobs for them.I sent an itemized dated, chronological accounting of the ruined items for 2 orders yet they continue to ask me to repeat the same info. Asking for a supervisor is also useless.In short:  they don’t care, and once they have your money, it’s gone, unless you report it to your bank/card provider and add on that battle.Instacart needs a lot of work to....work well.  The app also freezes and lacks details the website has, there are time delays in communication we have no control over, I have no idea what the shopper sees, but I do know my timeframe and delivery info works on my end.  Using Instacart is also costly. Here are some other FYI’s including fees and tips: You pay to join, for any upgrades, and there's another fee applied to each order. They add on a minescule shop/delivery tip automatically with the option for an increase up front (to enlist better service?). I tipped 20% in advance hoping for that with plans to tip more for great service and I still got bad service.  If you wait till after the delivery to tip more are you more likely you get bad service?  I do know you don't get refunds on tips...or anything else, so basically you're at the mercy of whoever gets your order (an Uber-like system...which is about quantity rather than quality with the “tip in advance” system).There have been significant issues with delivery timing and orders being left in the wrong place in full sun, hours before delivery in 90 degree heat resulting in ruined and unsafe perishables, and weeks later, no resolution or refund despite numerous tries.It takes just as long (or longer) to place the order with Instacart as it does to do the shopping yourself.  They offer choices of delivery times that are ignored, so you will need to place the order and wait at home until it is delivered or they will leave it at the door in the blazing sun in 80+ degree heat whenever it suits them. That means if you place the order at 8 AM for your dinner ingredients to arrive at 5 PM after all of your Drs appointments so nothing spoils, it won't happen that way, you will need to throw away said items, and you will NOT be reimbursed.  So, you will need to budget for the loss...if you can afford to.Each of those botched orders has resulted in $75 of unreimbursed tips, fees, and food we had to discard.  Can you afford that?The accuracy of your order is dependent upon the shopper/delivery person and available stock, so you'd better hope you get a someone pats attention and cares or you will get whatever they feel like making the effort for.  We need organic items due to fragile health. I tip at least 29% in advance for the added effort.  There have been many unauthorized subs we cannot eat, and in addition to the above issues we've also received part of other people's orders in error.There has not been a single order that has been 100% accurate regardless of the day of the week or time of day, the amount of the tip, and communication about substitutions are dependent on the integrity level of the shopper and whether the app is working properly or crashes.Its' way too much $$$ - After the math is done, ASIDE FROM FEES AND TIPS using Instacart has been a 50% more than shopping ourselves (plus the time to place the order), which is way too expensive for my family. I wish there were a better cempetitor.  At this point, I am going to pay a neighbor to help us. At least I will know what I'm getting, if they are healthy, and it will just be one fee."

One of the shoppers did not deliver several of the items that I ordered and paid for, and I had to call Instacart to request a refund for those items, in addition to having to drive to the store to purchase those items, which defeated the purpose of using instacart in the first place.  The last shopper that delivered an order, before I decided to discontinue using this service, not only failed to include several items that I bought and paid for, she also added a $15.99 wine cooler mixer pk to my order, and did not deliver, which means she kept it for herself.  I once again had to request a refund from Instacart.  I requested this refund 2 weeks ago, and as of today I still have not received the refund on my debit card.  Instacart needs to have a better checks and balance system for their shoppers so that these issues don't happen.  Their premise is convenience, but when you have to constantly request refunds, and drive to the store to purchase items that the shoppers forget to include, it's not very convenient."

I have has a handful of shoppers that have been great, but for the most part it has been a negative experience. Calling customer service is a whole experience in itself! Expect to get a call center in another country! Communication is less than good and just makes a bad situation worse. As far as the fee's and mark up on the items... hat is a complete joke and big rip off!!!! Here's an example, if the store has something on sale the instacart shopper will get the discount at check out, but it is no passed on to you. I just places an order and received the store receipt. It was emailed to me from the store as I have an account with them. Anyway, Instacart charged me BEFORE tip and service fees $39.69, the store's receipt total was $26.37. That's a mark-up of 50%. Highway robbery. Keep in mind that that does not include the tip and service fee. Then on top of that you are also paying a membership fee.  It wouldn't be so bad if at least you were able to enjoy the service you are paying for instead of being tied to your app while your shopper is shopping because the DO NOT take the time to read your notes.  The best is when they tell you I am new and I don't know how to do something.I have left several messages to have a manager contact me back and nobody has ever done so. I have also tried to get in touch with the corporate office and that hasn't been easy. Clearly they want to hide behind the customer service team. FYI Instacart... customer service can't fix most of your issues. Stop hiding behind them and start listing to the customers or at the very least, call them and see what you can do to help.  I could go on with more issues with them, but at the end of the day they will only fall on deaf ears. It appears that they look at this business like a cash cow. Customer service, properly trained shoppers and accountability are not very high on the priority list for them. I would suggest that you bypass instacart and either use Shipt or better yet...Amazon Fresh (NO FEES)!"

I ordered 3 bottles of Jim Beam Maple which is very hard to find and typically sells for $16 to $20 each. Instacart had it at $17 so I ordered 3 bottles. I checked their policy for alcohol delivery which states the delivery person must check the ID & insure the buyer is of age and not intoxicated before physically transferring the alcohol to the buyer.Two hours later the Instacart delivery driver ran up my stairs dropped 3 bottles of the wrong alcohol (Jim Beam Straight Bourbon) which is easy to find and $10/bottle.After the driver ran away I retrieved the package finding they delivered the wrong product. I immediately called customer service to get the correct product exchanged for the one that was delivered or refund my purchase. I was told I cannot return products during COVID19 after delivery has been accepted. I sent them my security video showing their driver never tried to get me to accept delivery of alcohol (which is illegal in CA). They would not refund the $48.75 or deliver the product I actually ordered. They only offered a credit to my account minus the delivery charge and expected me to accept the wrong product. I felt like I wanted to go to Instacart Headquarters in San Jose so I could shove the 3 bottles up the asses of the 3 top people who run Instacart but realized it would not be worth going to jail over this company that has no problem with breaking the law as well as the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced.So, in summary, Instacart expects customers to place orders for products they may or may not deliver but will issue no refunds, take no returns or attempt the correct product so customers should pay for products they did not order.I finally contacted my credit card company tied to Instacart, giving them the evidence of the illegal alcohol delivery and the wrong product, putting Instacart in breach of contract.

I ended up with an entire order of items that were horrible quality or nothing even close to what I had originally ordered.  My last order, I did not receive an item that I was charged for.  Contacted instacart for a refund. They apologized & said they were processing the refund.  Upon checking back, they gave me a CREDIT for a future purchase--AND IT EXPIRES! A credit that expires for an item I paid for and never received!? Nope.  I started to make a 4th order using the ""credit"" and upon check out the delivery jumped from 3.99 for my delivery yesterday, to 8.99 for a delivery today & a higher service fee! Nope! Nope! NOPE! I'll be shopping the old fashioned way from now on."

I have been a customer for years and experienced all the things other customers mention in these reviews. Had a big order stolen by the shopper once. Have MANY times had stuff show up as wrong item or damaged. Many shoppers just say they can’t find half the order when i know it is there. I have had to call the store and force them to help find it. Multiple times. The customer service agents are he worst.

Because we are still practicing social distancing, we instructed the shopper to leave the groceries in the garage. Upon arriving, the driver left the groceries in the designated area in the garage, but wnded up taking my keys to my car as well as my wedding ring!I noticed that my posessions was missing the following day after frantically searching all over my house for them. By that evening, I realized that I left it in the garage and discovered that it was missing! After talking with my wife about it, we realized that the delivery person stole it as he left the groceries exactly where I left my ring and keys.I immediately attempted to contact Instacart at 1-888-246-7822 the next day and spoke to Hector who told me that it would take between 24 to 48hrs before I would hear from someone. 24hrs passed, and I didn't hesr from anyone. I called back and this time talked to Allison. Allison reiterated that it would take up to 48hrs to hear back from their ""Trust and Safety"" team. She provided me a case number. Another 24hrs has since passed and I have NOT heard from anyone.

IC support couldn't explain that, and just apologized.IC support asked if I wanted a $10 credit and I could reorder my cancelled order.

Items that were a couple of dollars higher than the in-store pricing are now five dollars more than they were a few weeks ago. I once had the ability to select a preferred store location within a certain distance, and shoppers were able to choose which store they shopped at. Now they keep sending all of my shoppers exclusively   to the most poorly stocked and mismanaged store in the entire Publix chain (Sunshine Plaza). The prepared food selections are limited and the food is ALWAYS overcooked. Every time I buy Ice Cream it arrives melted, and looks like it has been refrozen more than once. I have repeatedly contacted CS to complain and request a different Publix location, but they say it is automated, and cannot be changed despite having several Publix stores within five miles of my home. Most are within three miles or less.I have had to place multiple orders on the same day and/or following day to complete my shopping because I rarely receive half my order. I am starting to think this failure is by design since the  minimum purchase amount of $35 per order regardless of whether it is due to missing, wrong, or damaged items. The dollar amount of what's missing is usually around $20, so I have to pad my next order with things i don't really need at the moment. That's some racket they've got going.Yesterday I discovered SHIPT, and I am thrilled with their service.

There shoppers are pretty good but it’s all messed up with the wrong Instacart suggestions and terrible store personels. The system is all messed up as two person shopped for my order at once.

I called Instacart first and the young man I spoke with simply deflected blame to Kroger.  I explained to him that it is clear Instacart workers shop for you, so he should not blame Kroger.  If Kroger collected the items and had them waiting for Instacart to pick up, I can see how his explanation might hold water. Also, it is the Instacart worker who is supposed to let Kroger know what they picked up.  Instacart workers usually do not search for your items. It is my impression that in many cases, (not all,) that they quickly go through and pick up what is easy to find. I contacted Kroger about this and the nice person laughed and let me know that she wasn't laughing at me.  I was told that customer service has so many problems and they are constant.  The person told me that they have to refund customers all the time because Instacart workers will actually pick up additional items which were not ordered and charge the customer.  She said that many times, the customer isn't aware.  She said that one time a person ordered tuna and received cat food.  I am in no way stating that there are not some reliable and dedicated workers, but evidently there aren't protections in place for the consumer, and Instacart is not doing enough to correct these issues.  If Kroger isn't willing to take the time to evaluate the complaints and address leadership about this big problem, maybe the Consumer Protection Division should investigate Instacart. Kroger should talk with their customer service and get to the bottom of this."

The agent said she would refund me $37 but instead, I found out when I phoned today, that it was put as a credit on my account. The agent I spoke with today said he would refund the money but would't listen when I tried to tell him I didn't owe what their receipt states.  So my calculation is as follows:Store sub total - $171.58Instacart fees and taxes - 3.99 + 9.08 + 9.08 (mandatory tip) + Grocery Hst - 1.83 + their taxes 2.00 = 25.98Total receipt - 197.56 - from $230 they took from my account - 32.44 should be returned plus the 37 refund - a total of $69.44 should be returned to my account.

Items I ordered and had paid for were missing. (I was not contacted during the shopping process for notification that those items were out of stock and asked if I wanted a replacement or refund. This wasn’t the issue.) These items apparently were just missed during the shopping process.  Luckily, I noticed those items were missing and checked my receipt and saw that I was charged for them. I went to their website and clicked on the missing items, as prompted.  My ONLY options then were to receive a credit or get a refund. NO option to request that the remaining items on my order be completed and delivered.  I finally found a phone number that I called and got customer service people in South Africa who offered a host of excuse, but obviously can’t resolve errors made by Instacart.  All I wanted, was for them to fix THEIR error, request that my shopping order be completed and delivered.  They claimed they can’t do that.  I would have to place another $35 minimum order, if I wanted to get the missing items from my last order.  Although the error was theirs, they claimed they can’t waive the $35 minimum order, to provide a way of getting and delivering the rest of the items they had missed on my order. My complaint is not with the shopper, who most likely just overlooked some items. It’s with the company who doesn’t rectify errors.  I’m sure this happens on occasion, yet they have no solution in place to accommodate their customers when Instacart doesn’t process an order correctly. I’ve never encountered a company that wasn’t willing, nor have a process in place, to fix an error on their part and try to provide good service to their customers.  Although we’re still in a Pandemic, I’ll not use their services again because of their lack of accountability to their customers.  Mistakes happen; but having no way to fix the mistake is unacceptable.  It’s very disappointing, as it could be a good service, except they don’t stand behind their service."

This order went smoothly and the delivery drivers were very nice. Thinking the first time was a fluke, I ordered a third time. Everything seemed to be going well. Next thing I know, the shopper is saying that my card was declined (not sure why since instacart had already take my money). I tried explaining this, but the driver said she didn’t have time to deal with me and told me to cancel my order. Since “Shopping was in progress,” I couldn’t cancel online and another driver was assigned to my order. This caused additional issues since instacart assumed that my order was being handled by driver #1. This caused driver #2 to be equally as rude about having an empty order and kept telling me to cancel while I was trying to figure out how to do that (phone number listed doesn’t work). Instacart can’t be blamed for the rude people I live near. But, their system is less than satisfactory. I will never order off of instacart again."

At checkout the company card (we use to pay for the customer purchases) declines when everything was correct on the order, and I have to pry chat support to get them to cancel, only to get an automated system not telling me how to fix the decline, but the company asking me if I can pay for it with my own money. I refused, and now am lost completely in how to continue with this company that does not train its employees. I was ""self trained"" by the faq's on their app, After reading these reviews from the customers, I can say its not just the suspected ""shopper stole them"" but also could be declines on the company card due to price inconsistencies, as well as giving incorrect adresses to the shopper, primarily wrong zip code. To note, I did not recieve any of the customers cash during this order after cancelling, so i'm unsure if most shoppers are actually pocketing groceries/money but from what I know now, Instacart steals from its customers by not returning their money back and also overcharging. As an employee there was no way to reach support either for any app issues or payment issues. Both shopper and customer are left it the dark in what's actually happening in these situations. I now don't want to continue for a company that doesn't refund the money to the customers. On the flip side the company even asks us to pay for the items ourselves if we experience company card issues, and I have heard mutiple reports of employees not being reimbursed as promised. Same just like the customer. I don't feel comfortable working for them anymore knowing so much can go wrong easily to make me look like a fake. We don't get paid enough for shopping, $7 base and own gas, so who knows what all shoppers are doing in actuality, but half of us are really trying to get the orders done and being failed by inconsistencies in the app. Blame it on the company pretty much! This is absurd for this to be happening during this crisis, we all need money, and are hungry!"

I told them no.  I tried calling instacart and the wait was over 300 minutes which was after the delivery was to take place.I reached out to the instacart shoppers via the chat function to see if they knew what was going on.  They did not.Upon delivery I complained to instacart via the app within hours of the duplicated deliveries.  I did not request a refund for any of the items that were non perishable since I could actually use them at some point even though I did not order them.April 5th - I sent a follow upApril 6th - I sent a follow upApril 16th - I sent a follow upApril 22nd - I sent a follow up May 2nd I sent a follow upInstacart responds that they did their research and my claim was legitimate.

I respond to Jio that I made the complaint and escalated the issue the day of the delivery and I needed him to escalate the issue internally because we were going nowhere.  Unfortunately since it has been over a month since I made the complaint it was too late to dispute the charge with my credit card company.Since May 8th I have been continuing to contact the instacart team and spinning my wheels.  I just need someone to take a look at this issue and process the refund.

I WAS going to give you a refund, but not NOW!"" I hadn't given her any order information and as the conversation continued it seemed like she wasn't looking at my receipt at all. The situation escalated from there as she rattled off a host of weird excuses, including saying that I was seeing someone else's receipt ""mixed in"" with mine. I asked her how that was possible and she screamed, ""NO! NO DOG TREATS! NOT YOURS!"" so loud that I started hearing buzzing and her audio started intermittently cutting out, at which point I said I couldn't hear her, she started yelling again (which I couldn't make out) so I hung up and tried again. The second service rep noticed two items (vegetables) on his copy of the receipt which were not on mine; instead, there were two dog treats. I got neither the vegetables I was supposed to get nor the dog treats I was charged for. He kept saying his receipt didn't have dog treats so I wasn't charged for them, but I definitely was, and he absolutely refused to acknowledge what happened. He also started offering weird excuses, saying I ""wasn't supposed to get a paper receipt"" (I didn't get one, I have no idea what he's talking about) and also that ""one tomato is only $1.64,"" which didn't seem to have any bearing on the matter. It felt very much like they were instructed to say a whole bunch of confusing stuff just to get people to give up and not try to get the situation resolved.

Dillon's was very helpful when I called them about what happened, but if they insist on using Instacart, I can't trust them. I very much recommend avoiding Instacart if at all possible.

On the day of delivery, they’re informing me of everything as they go along as well as offering substitutes. Everything was going well...But then upon delivery, I inform them that there is a cart in the lobby area past the elevators and next to the office. So I’m thinking everything is still smooth... until I get a call from my parents 10 minutes after receiving the final “your groceries have been delivered...” and asking for a tip. My mother tells me they hadn’t received anything. So she has my father go all the way downstairs to check. (I’m at work, unable to just drop everything and go myself.) As soon as the elevator doors open on the first floor, all he sees is a case of water and a couple of Arizona iced teas on the floor. Everyone in the building of the senior lifts had thought it was free food and took all their groceries leaving the heavier items. And my parents aren’t able to walk without assistance. I was livid!!! I’m a healthcare busy at the hospital and I’ve been singing praises of people who still go out and put themselves in harms way to deliver groceries on the same level. But this experience just made me so incredibly mad because I already have no help in caring for my parents. It’s already hard enough for me to do everything on top of working and school. I thought I’d be able to get some help. But at least they refunded my money. So they at least get a #1 for that."

I contacted Instacart and they claim they will be refunding me my money, which they better, or they will be hearing from me again until this is resolved. Don't these people have GPS? On top of everything else, the shopper/driver took it upon herself to replace an item without contacting me first. I found that out from a text I received from Instacart. I kept texting her, and she never replied except to say that I don't know my address and she dropped the items off. Instacart is supposed to help you so you can keep social distancing, not make your life harder. Suffice it to say, I will never use Instacart again!"

I want to know what I am paying for. I want to see my receipt IN THE BAG, and if it can't be in the bag, I should be able to go online and pull up the ENTIRE order like I do with Amazon, not just the first page. You go to ""next"" for the rest of your order and you just don't get it.  No place on the website where to ask a question, and haven't got all day to spend on it.  Also, in order to get the ""free"" $3.99 fee waived on orders over $35.00, you have to sign up for a fee for a year to get the Express discount.  First order, Instacart erred $20.00 (in their favor) of course, which I disputed at the bank and the bank fixed it.  The shopper did not contact me as requested by phone when delivered, and (refrigerated) groceries sat in the lobby for an hour, otherwise, I would give the shoppers 4 stars for punctuality and delivery.  We pay enough for this service between the fees and tip.  We are entitled to a proper receipt and a response from Price-Right instead of the runaround we get.

However, it is not always clear how much will get charged to your account and - more importantly - they will place a hold on your money even if an order wasn't actually placed.Just last week, I tried to place an order (around $120 in item costs) and had a $175 charge appear on my bank statement though *no order was actually placed*; I didn't receive any items and there was no record that I had been charged, except through my bank.  Fortunately, I had enough to cover the charge, but I can imagine many situations where this would cause an overdraft.  It took 6 days for this amount to be refunded to my account.(5) Customer service is terrible, basically nonexistentEvery time I have tried to contact customer service (except last week), I have just given up instead, because it is such a frustrating process.  While the rest of their website is gorgeous and well put together, the customer service parts seem like they were built in the early 90s - completely laughable.  The easiest way to get in touch seems to be through the barely functional chat box, though it still took me close to 2 hours last week to get an answer about why my account had been charged without an order.  The first time I got connected to an agent on the chat, they took so long between responses that the chat timed out and I had to restart the process.  I would never have imagined it would take 2 hours to have someone tell me 'Yeah, we don't know if there is an order or when the charge will be removed - probably around a week'.  It's like their system is built to be frustrating, to keep people from reaching out or asking questions.In general, it just seems like Instacart does not care about us as customers or as workers/shoppers - they only care about getting your coins and once they have them, everything else is up in the air.  Avoid this service unless you don't care how, when, or *if* you get the groceries you paid for."

Apparently part of the cover up is to withhold the store receipt from customers so customers don't see how much of an up charge Instacart keeps.  So I am done with Instacart.  I will never use them again.  Buyer beware - INSTACART IS A REALLY EXPENSIVE WAY TO SHOP!!!"

It took me four tries to have a full conversation with an agent. The first three times, their system would end the chat while the agent ""looked into"" the issue. I am truly sympathetic to the Customer Service world, but this was the worst experience. Most customers know that prices are inflated on Instacart; however, please be aware that if you choose ""1 pound"" of oranges let's say, you could receive ONE orange, yet still be charged for a full pound. Also, the shopper can make random, cheaper replacements WITHOUT your approval, yet you're still charged for the original price (for instance, I ordered a full gallon of milk from a specific brand, yet ended up with half a gallon from a whole different brand. The shopper didn't even request approval to swap). PLEASE review your items and make sure you got exactly what you asked for (or the approved swaps).There's a lot of funky math and plain robbery going on at Instacart. I understand that these are chaotic times, but Instacart really needs to reevaluate its model. They also need to revamp their CX system and retrain their agents and shoppers. Although convenient, I won't be using Instacart again for the foreseeable future.You're better off taking the risk of going to the supermarket; at least then you can be sure that you're paying what you truly owe."

Good communication and good substitutions etc. The drivers I've dealt with have all been fantastic. That is not the problem. The problem is the COMPANY itself. One of my orders never arrived at all, yet I was charged. It was a 30 item order so pretty large, and the shopper refunded 29 of the items (either to not have to shop as much and keep the delivery fee and tip or because he really couldn't find 29 of the items...) but the point is nothing ever came, although the update came through that the delivery was complete. I've been home all the time as we all have and nobody showed up. So, I contacted Instacart's customer service and explained the situation. No reply. I sent reminders. No reply. I then disputed the charge with my cc company (small amount - less than $15 since it was just the one item that was ""delivered""). I've placed a few orders since the dispute and one arrived a few days ago - no issues at all. I had another order planned for today, but woke up this morning to a message in my email about my dispute and another email to say my pending order was canceled but no to worry, because I could ""re-order with one click"". I tried logging in and resetting my password but nothing worked. Then I tried logging in using my Apple ID to gain access to my account and then I received the message my account had been canceled. So, because I disputed a less than $15 charge with them for NON delivery (so we don't call it pure theft on their or their driver's behalf), they feel they should cancel my account? Unbelievably unprofessional and poor service. Hey IC, anybody can be a middle man and pay someone to shop for them. You App is pretty nice, but your company is a joke. I hope the drivers find other jobs for more respectable companies. I for one will never use IC ever again. Good riddance."

My first impression was non satisfying. Three of my most important items were not delivered. My loaf of bread from the middle back was COMPLETELY smashed. I had someone else’s item as well. The time it took me to go out later that evening to get my items and getting on the app to figure out how to talk to someone about my issues was impossible and a huge waste of my time. No one reached out to me for the mistakes or even offered to have my missing items delivered to me. Instead i was just given a credit on my next order and the only reason i found that credit was because i was searching for a way to speak to someone. I had spoken by chat to someone before i had made the decision to give it a try (and have it saved) that the answer to my question said “Tip” did not mean an actually “Tip” to the shopper. It was a service charge in the “service fee” but the person i spoke with today (by the way, i had to get the number from my bank to call and speak with a representative, because no number or email to speak with anyone is listed in the settings.) told me today that the shopper was given a tip listed on the receipt.

Note that one item was $18 for chicken...lol. Who would pay $18 for a few chicken breast?  I called in and left messages, sent emails, and messaged them on FB. NO ONE responded. I finally decided to dispute the charge through my bank and received the money back with in a few days. Yesterday they sent me an email about my card being de-linked because of an issue. REALLY!! They couldn't send an email saying they were sorry that I had a bad experience or even try to make it right. I will never use them again and will tell EVERYONE I know not to use them. I hope they realize they are not the only delivery company there."

No phone call, no text, no message at all. I ended up with no meat and several items stated that they weren't in stock and no substitutes available.  In the past, the shopper would send messages and I had the opportunity to add something else in its place--NOT today.  I received about 60% of my order.  I have a note in my profile that the shopper needs  to navigate a 700' driveway, but they didn't come to the house.  The groceries were left sitting beside a large bin for deliveries in the rain--no email, text or phone call.  There were meat, dairy and frozen items.  I called the customer service number I found in an internet search, and said that they were receiving more calls than they could handle and the call was disconnected.

They overcharge and will not refund***1. The website offered replacement items that cost more than the item ordered, which is fine, but when I received the cheaper original item in my order I was still charged for the pricey replacement item. The receipt that came with my groceries was $204 including tax, the charge (for only groceries) was $245 including the tax online and on my credit card.2. The website would give one price but at the checkout it would be another. For an example, Meat Pies were 1.66 online, the receipt shows that they are .99, I was charged for the online price. I ordered two sweet potatoes which came to $2.81, the website charged me $10.98. 3. When I contacted Instacart about this, they only addressed the sweet potato weight difference and offered a credit to my account of $20. I was not happy with that solution as it did not match the overcharge that was taken from my credit card. 4. Rocio then said he would send me a refund. 'We really sorry for this inconvenience I refunded to your account the difference overcharged than you ordered.It take 5-10 days to process depend of your bank.Regards,RocioInstacart CareI only received $11.89 refunded on my credit card. Needless to say, I will never use this service again. I question how often these overcharges happen in their favour without people noticing or having the time to sort it out. BBB has a long list of complaints about this service, today another one. If they just refunded me the overcharge to begin with, they would have kept a customer, the customer's friends and  family would have heard great reviews instead of a warning about the company, and the public would have one less bad review to read and share on social media."

Shoppers DO NOT listen to instructions. I specifically put to deliver to the blue doors and not the side door as our renter lives there and may think someone bought the groceries for him. It's not that he would steal them, it's that he may think someone ordered it for him and he'd take it. Only TWICE were the instructions followed.Then they charge you for the groceries but they're not included. One dumb shopper took a picture of what she delivered PROVING that she did not deliver all of the items, yet i was charged for them. My pre-authorization charge for one shopping was returned and correctly charged to the right amount. The other three are still there and they're saying, as I type this, that my bank will remove 24-48 hours. BS. The bank always removes it the same day and charges it correctly the same day BASED on what they are charging. This was the only time a pre-authorization charge remained and the amount that should be charged not charged. I understand pre-authorization charges can take time with some companies but that doesn't happen with THIS company.Out of 8 orders, 4 of them were fine, other 4 were terrible. How do you get it wrong 50% of the time? And I believe if I keep using them, the amount of screw ups from the dumb shoppers they have will increase. I am searching for another grocery delivery company that has the same choices as Instacart does. If Walmart didn't have half their crap as in store only, I'd dump this horrible company in a heartbeat.  I HATE this company. But they have a wide variety of stores to choose from so I'm stuck with this. I don't want to pay a yearly membership for BJs and Costco and I don't purchase all of the items there anyways.  If your area has more than 1 grocery store delivery options where both have a variety of stores to shop from AVOID INSTACART AT ALL COST."

Store receipt was $86.96, but they charged me 96.44, but it does not stop there.  It is also all the other costs involved that are multiple, and in part deceptive, and I felt like by the end of it, I was fleeced.  The order, not including tip was 25% more than what I would have paid in the store.There is the Delivery fee, the service fee, and then the pressure to tip, because you get the sense that the person doing the shopping is depending on this as the main source of income, and then the kicker...……..  The price that is at the store is not the price that they charge, and there is not a clear, transparent way to know this.  I was told afterwards that if you go to a certain page and look at a specific link, click on it, and then that will let me know if they are charging the shelf price or not.Store actual receipt  - $86.96 (including tax)Instacart charged     - $96.44Delivery Fee             - $8.99Sales tax                  - $5.41Tip                           - $9.64Service Fee              - $4.82Total Billed               - $125.3033% higher to use Instacart, after tip taken out.Total BS, and when I called them out on it, they offered a $10 credit on the next time they rip me off...…..uhhhmmm, I mean the next order I place.If you are going to be in this game after quarantine, you need to have a different business model that MAYBE has a slight higher cost model than shopping in person, but no where near 33%Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.

Doesn't even deserve 1 star","Worst experience ever. One star is being generous. The first time I ordered through Instacart, I ordered 2 days in advance. The day of delivery, I had 3 or 4 different shoppers.... after being delayed 5 hours, I asked the 3rd shopper ""are you going to be able to deliver by 5 pm."" she simply replied ""Cancel order."" in the chat box and stopped responding. So, I sat on hold with Customer Service for more than an hour, they reassigned it and gave a $20 credit. Great. They guy who delivered then was great, except he smoked in the car and my grocery bags smelled like smoke. I'm highly allergic. So fast forward a few weeks, I decide to give it another go and use my $20 credit. I ordered from 2 stores - Central Market and Costco. Central Market totaled around $125 before fees, Costco was $13. I receive a notice through the app my Central Mrkt order was being shopped, in 5 or 10 min I get another notice it was complete. I thought WOW they were fast. I looked at the receipt and noticed there were a ton of adjustments that the shopper never asked me about, increasing my order total. Shortly after I got a notice my Costco order was being shopped by a different shopper. I then noticed my Central Market was allegedly delivered....problem is, it wasn't. I was home all day and nothing. I drove up & down my street checking neighboring houses - nothing. I asked my Costco shopper if she had it. She said no. I got my 2 items from Costco. After a rabbit trail through the app, I finally was able to mark all items in the CM order as missing. I tried to call - Instacart isn't taking calls - my guess is because they're hammered with customer complaints. Couldn't access chat at all. I emailed customer support multiple times. Never received an answer. Three days later I finally gave it another go and was able to get into the Chat queue. Spoke with someone, told him the story, he refunded the CM items, but failed to reapply my $20 credit to my Costco order and left it on the CM order that was being refunded, so the refund is short by $20 bucks.... or they've retained their fees for a service they never performed. Just today my neighbor also ordered from them and had very similar problems. I am done with this service and will be speaking with my bank once the bill for CM clears. Ironically, the day I was supposed to have received my order and didn't, I went to the store myself. Shopped the exact same items, added a few additional things and stuff for my neighbors. My total was substantially less than through Instacart for more items. Don't waste your time or money on this service. It is a joke!!"

They never said on their site that I would need any app and, to tell you the truth, I still don't know if it's the Wegman's app (the store I ordered through) or InstaCart app.  She apologized and said she would refund the three items at issue. Even if she had just refunded the one and charged me the price for the items I had ordered on the others would have been acceptable, but she said (notice ""said"") she would refund all three, so I was very pleased.  She was very pleasant and said at the end that, for my troubles she was giving me a $10 credit to order on InstaCart again.  I told her that was not necessary and she said, don't worry, I'd like to.  I thanked her again several times.  Sound great, right?  It is now over a week and I have not received any of the refunded amounts or the credit that were promised.

I couldn't wait, so I cancelled the order. 9 days later, the hold was removed from my account and then 7 days later, THEY TOOK THE $475 BACK AGAIN!!!!! So I have no groceries and they  STOLE MY MONEY. I chatted in for help (FYI, you can get support through chat pretty quickly, but you have to log into your account and navigate through the pages until it works to open a chat) and they told me they would look into it and get back to me by the afternoon. No response. So I chat back in again the next day, and they apparently have no record of me contacting them. Now, I wait on hold with chat while they investigate....."

This company steals your money and takes too much money out without your permission. on top of that, they charge you a ridiculous service fee AND delivery fee on top of that. Why charge twice?? Such a rip off!! Terrible service and the workers there dont even know how to do their job properly. You’re best ordering your groceries through Walmart online cuz they dont charge you all sorts of fees and steal your money like instacart does. I would give this company ZERO STARS if there was an option for that. Highly NOT recommended unless you dont care to get scammed by them."

Lambert,1 star: Bad,INSTACART IS WORSE THAN COVID19,"I believe that most of us can be a little flexible and patient during a pandemic but this company’s operations are flat out inexcusable, if not criminal.1. Paper towels were missing from my order so I clicked the button that said report a problem. I requested 56.98 refund. They deducted the 55.98 from my credit card. I was happy ! However, the next day they charged me 56.98 which basically canceled my entitled refund. I disputed the charge with Amex. However, their customer service line does not take calls and good luck getting any kind of replies to an email. If instacart is not accessible then, according to Amex, I win the dispute. I encourage everyone to put false charges in dispute.2. Due to the above activity on my credit card, initiated by Instacart , they sent me an email saying there was suspicious activity on my credit card and deactivated my account. They are the ones who created the suspicious activity. At the same time my account was deactivated I received an email from them requesting photos of my drivers license and the last four digits of my credit card. They wanted me to authenticate my identity in order to reactivate my account. First of all who sends such sensitive documentation via email to anyone? Secondly, the email address to send such documentation was not valid.3. I really want my account activated because I need the 25 pound bags of cat food delivered to feed  ferals. For the cats I will put up with almost anything.  4. I called the customer service number to find out how to get my account reactivated. It’s inoperable. Try sending a message? You will die waiting for a response.  If you have Tylenol in your medicine cabinet just in case you get the virus then I guarantee that you will be using it for headaches courtesy of Instacart.5. WHY DO BJS,  COSTCO and other big stores allow their home delivery to be powered by Instacart? It makes my membership less valuable. I pay membership fees for the luxury of getting home delivery. I am not getting the full benefit of my membership if my instacart account was deactivated with no recourse."

That is a wopping 26.67%  To add insult to injury, the shopper-delivery person stole 3 of my organic avocados at $2 per piece. That comes out to be another $6.  That is a costly adventure.  Does Instacart not vet their delivery shoppers?  The problem with the Instacart website is it asks you if any item is missing? Technically, I get my avocados BUT 3 ARE MISSING.  There is no place on the website to allow me to put down how many avocados are missing.  IT IS A SERVICE THAT IS TOO COSTLY. I WILL NEVER USE IT AGAIN.

Out of twenty items I ordered I was missing 11 items. Those items I did receive were not even the same brand that I selected online and where my quantity was 2 there was only 1. Basically, for those items I did not receive, the shopper\delivery person just shoplifted my food from the grocery store and that’s theft, larceny!

I have had item say item were purchased but not delivered. I have someone show up an hour early, we were not even home yet. And now learn there are unknown fees that shopper can choose to add or not. My order today was $167.00 after all their fees I was billed $201.00. I am so over it."

I've used Instacart for over 6 months and until COVID it was great, so I will cut some slack under the current crazy marketplace circumstances.  HOWEVER, this is just about 100% totally inept and dysfunctional customer service.  I placed an order last Friday for evening delivery-- it showed ""order in progress"" for over 2 hours, with only 2 items shopped, and the delivery never showed up.  On the app my order suddenly was listed as to be delivered on Saturday between 3-5pm.  Again, order was ""in progress"" for hours with the same 2 items being shopped.  When I contacted Customer Service via the app-- because they don't take phone calls!-- I was told the shopper ""couldn't complete the order"", whatever that means.  They had no ability to find an alternate shopper so I would need to be rescheduled until Tuesday, nothing open sooner.  Ok, fine, I understand these are unusual times.Today is Tuesday and the adventure continues.  My order was scheduled for 3-5pm delivery.  Yesterday evening I added several additional items I needed, which is a normal process most of the time.  Around 1pm I get text messages from TWO different shoppers who are filling my order-- but there's only one new order pending in my account.  Neither shopper knew how this happened and neither was willing to ""stand down"", and one is asking me to tell the other to stop shopping!  We three each independently reached out to Customer Service.  One shopper is called off the assignment and the other one, very kind woman, continues.  She delivers my groceries about 1 hour later and (can you guess what's coming??) the order is incorrect!  It's an order I placed 2 weeks ago!  Fortunately there were some same items so I wasn't totally out of luck, but I only received about 13 of 37 items I needed.Back to Customer Service I go, and about 25 minutes hanging online later it's determined that Instacart can get a shopper to pick up & deliver the missing items right away.  Keep in mind I've been very firm but patient through all the communication; giving the benefit of the doubt, and catching more flies with honey than vinegar...  The latest shopper starts buying items I already received so I text her about the earlier partial delivery, and I send her a list of what I no longer need.  She stops shopping, needs to check with Customer Service (starting to feel like a CS drinking game at this point), so another 30 minutes passes waiting.  She comes back online and says all is good and she'll continue shopping--great!  But not so great.  She begins to refund nearly every item on my list, so I text her to ask why because I'm confused what CS told her to do.  She said ""I'm refunding the items you received earlier."", and I tell her ""NO, these are the items I DID NOT receive and are supposed to still be delivered.""  I told her if it was easier at this point for me to cancel the order and she can stop shopping, that's fine-- she immediately agreed.Another reach out to CS, I start my chat by saying ""I've talked to 3 agents within a few hours and my order is still totally messed up.  Please put me in touch with a supervisor immediately.""  The CS agent doesn't object and tells me she's transfering me.  I hung online for 15 minutes, then asked ""How's it going finding a supervisor?""  The agent returned after a while to say she was sorry, but they were ""asking for your phone number and email address to contact you directly.  They will call you back.""  Hmmm, will they, I wonder?  I gave her my info, told her I'm accessible anytime, and here I wait. In the meantime, all this BS has resulted in a pending charges on my bank account of over $200-- the actual items I received were less than $70.I agree with an earlier reviewer that 0 stars should be an option.  Order at your own risk!"

Just received an Instacart final bill for items delivered yesterday.  Everything went very well and I received all items.  The delivery person brought one (1) package of a different brand of toilet paper and explained why.   This was fine.   I went online and increased the tip on my order.Today I got the instacart final bill.   I was billed for 2 (two) packages of the replacement toilet paper at $10 each, $20 total.   There is no way to contact instacart because their phone line today (April 14, 2020) is not accepting any more calls due to corona virus!   I filled out the online form and submitted it.  I don't know why instacart thinks double charging for a replacement item is acceptable.   I cannot afford to lose $10 this way -- not to mention that just overcharging because I might not notice is outrageous.   I will not be using instacart again.UPDATE -- Surprisingly I got an automated response from Instacart already.   However they refunded me double the overcharge by indicating that I did not get any TP - instead of just the one actual package.   To me this is as much a problem as the overcharge.   I do not want to pay extra and I do not want to pay too little.   I especially hope they are not billing the delivery person for the company's mistake in overcharging me.  I'd give the delivery person a 10 (great!), but the company itself maybe a 2-3 for making not one but two billing errors at this point and for having no customer service people to take my phone call (in addition to emails) to try to straighten this out.   While there is a number to call, the outgoing message is that they are not taking any calls currently because of the CV19 issue."

I ordered groceries from Instacart from my local Giant grocery store in Owings Mills, MD on 4/6. It was originally suppose to be delivered on April 11th. I then received notification that due to COVID-19 the order delivery date would be pushed back. I understood especially with all that is going on. I then received a notification on Saturday the original order date saying Alisha was shopping for my groceries. I thought that was odd but was happy the groceries were being picked up and delivered on my original date. The shopper sent me notifications of what items were not available, etc and I choose different options. Later I received a call from the shopper saying she was outside. I asked her to leave the items at the door for me to pick up so we would not be in contact with each other. I hung up the phone and walk to the front door and there were no groceries. I called the number back immediately and an automated system said no one was available to answer my call. It even got to the point where my husband and I thought maybe she got the house number mixed up and drive through our community to see if it was on one of our neighbors stairs by accident. That was not the case. I then called Giant who informed me that they are in no way affiliated with Instacart. I went to their website to try and email or chat with someone that way. I then found a place where I could start a chat and so I initiated the request. The automatic message stated they were busy and I was number 2169 in line. I left the chat open and went to bed as it was already 2am in the morning. The next morning the chat disappeared and I received an email asking me to rate my experience with speaking with someone name William. I did not speak with anyone at all. I tried calling again and another automated voice stated I no longer have an order with them and I should visit their website if anything else is needed. I sent a message back to the email requesting a rating but no response their either.

I decided to take advantage of the opportunity for home delivery of the items I ordered through InstaCart.  Once I confirmed my order online, the order total was $140.00.  There was a note at the end of the order saying my credit card would be authorized for $160.00 in the event items I ordered needed to be substituted for other items, which could be more expensive.  Seemed reasonable to me.  On April 11, 2020, I noticed a charge on my credit card for $160.00 for Bjs.  The order was scheduled to arrive anywhere between April 11 and April 16, 2020. This was okay as well as I figured many people were using this service and I was not in immediate need for the items I ordered. On April 13, 2020, the items I ordered arrived at my doorstep, as I requested.  When I checked my account at Bjs.com to determine the actual total of my order since some items were substituted, the ordered totaled $148.05, which they said would show up on my credit card statement in 7 business days.  When I checked my credit card balance, I noticed that Bjs initiated another charge on my credit card in the amount of $160.00.  There are now two (2) separate charges  on my credit card for $160.00 each totaling $320.00 for the order I received today.  When I spoke with someone at Bjs, they said InstaCart initiated the charges om my card and I would need to contact them. When I called Instacart's toll free number, there was no response, which I understand.  Therefore, I sent an email, to which an autoreply indicated it would be while before I would get a response.  Here's what I learned, InstaCart will initiate a charge on your credit card the day that you place the order, and they will also initiate another charge on the day the person shops for your order, if they do not occur on the same date.  And, given the high use of the service, this is likely to happen.  So, my credit card was charged $320.00 for $148.05 in grocery items and I cannot get in touch with anyone at InstaCart to correct this matter.  Fortunately, I contacted my credit card company to request a refund of the additional charge.  Buyer beware, if you are overcharged by InstaCart, you'll have significant problems trying to reach someone to correct the problem."

They have a very frustrating way to report a problem and they rarely answer complaints."

I regretted those experiences so much that I decided not to use them again. Here is a summary of what I saw in those two trips:1- Shoppers are clueless. It took the guy to do back and forth with me about what to buy and what to replace for over 2 hours. How come a shopping list containing around 10 items take that long. In the end I received my delivery but icecream was melted and leaked also I realized that I did not receive some of the items but still got charged for them (market receipt does not match the web receipt in terms of the items purchased) 2-Their mark up is pretty steep. On top of instacart express fee, service fee and shopper tip I still need to pay a mark up on every item on my list. This bussiness model can not survive. They should make deals with the groceries and get special discounts rather than putting the extra fee on the customer.3- For both my trips I had issues with items that I got charged for but did not receive ( I have market receipts to confirm this claim) However no matter howmany times I tried to reach them they were not accessible. So over two weeks from my purchase I am yet to find someone to discuss about my refund...I cancelled my instacart express membership and will not consider using this service ever again.

Then, early this afternoon I start getting emails from the shopper. What a fricken nightmare. Every 30 seconds, he texted that an item was unavailable. Then, the next 30 seconds, do I want a replacement. This went on and on for over an hour. I ordered 26 items, and got 10. Only the milk and wine were actual items I ordered. Then, there was an item charged to me that I didn't receive. Then, I compared the receipt given to me by the driver and the receipt spit out by Instacart. There was over $21 in discrepancies. . .to Instacart's favor. A ham I bought was $22.31 on my receipt from the store, but $39.12 in Instacart's receipt. That price was even higher than the regular price of the ham ($33.62) - the in store sale of $11.21 = $22.I cannot even figure out how dispute the charges. Plus, there was over $19 in charges. No where did it say there was a $2 alcohol fee until I hit confirm order. That royally ticked me off. Then, there was a delivery fee and a service fee and a tip and a bag fee. Really? This was so not worth it. I will never do this again. It was an utter rip off. I feel so stupid for doing it. I wished I listened to my gut."

I attempted to contact the number on their website and received a message stating they are not accepting calls. It was very difficult to find any additional contact information to report the problem. I finally found a way through my Costco login and order but Instacart's system doesn't allow you to type comments and all I received back was an email with a ticket number and no additional contact information. I am frustrated that I am being laid off from my job and was overcharged $163 and cannot make contact or receive a response. I am also concerned because their refund policy states that you need to contact Instacart immediately because they can only process refunds within 7 days.Wanted to provide an update that as of April 24th I still have not been able to contact Instacart and have not received a response to the 4 emails I have sent them and my money has not been refunded.

My problem is that after putting away my groceries, I always go on the Kroger app and check my receipt because instacart never gives a receipt. Come to find out shoppers are making unauthorized purchases with my money. I have had this happen at least 3 times that I'm aware of and this last one was $40.68!!! Are you kidding me? Then when you call to report it to the store they say nothing they can do about it and that you have to contact instacart. When you call instacart, they are not in office due to covid19. So pretty much the shopper can steal from you and there will be no repercussions. All I can say is check your receipt online after each purchase."

BTW - I am on the opposite coast.  I went through my emails, and five minutes before the supposed delivery, there was one with a $500 tip to the delivery person, named ""Josh"". In any case, I will take my chances with the COVID 19 by doing my own shopping now and into the far future. Thanks but no thanks, InstaCart. Get your IT security under control.

AS FAR AS YOU CAN FROM INSTACART,"Ok. I completely understand we are in the middle of a global pandemic and the demand for these type of services has skyrocketed, leaving many businesses overwhelmed. With that being said this is the absolute worst service I have ever used, if you can even call it a service. I highly believe I was frauded. Please take note of mine and others reviews on here and DO NOT USE INSTACART. This was my first time using this service just like a lot of others because of the quarantine. I placed my order on 4/9 for flexible delivery, which basically you get delivered whenever someone is available. It was scheduled for delivery latest today 4/10 in the evening, however I received a notification on same day as ordered that the shopper was already shopping for it. Not terrible I was pretty impressed at that point that it was going to be delivered early. All downhill from there. This was a large 135 dollar order and every 30 seconds I was responding to a message from the shopper about a replacement or refund for out of stock items. Some items were to be replaced with items that costed more and were less quantity and items were refunded that I personally know the grocery store has because I shop there a lot. Out of hummus? Really? With no replacements? Is hummus a high commodity item in a pandemic?. Anyways, after all of that I get a notification that the shopper is checking out, great right? Wrong! About 2 minutes later I get a text from the shopper that she has to cancel my order because her instacart pay card was stolen. At this point I was over it already and honestly happy that this was going to be cancelled and get my money back. Wrong again! After inquiring how I get refunded for the cancelled order, the shopper states that they are on hold with the instacart support. After about 20 minutes I follow up with the shopper and turns out they disconnected the chat! So no way to contact the shopper or anything! Furthermore, the order was never cancelled via instacart so my order still shows that it is active and being shopped for which is causing a hold on my bank account of 135 dollars. Naturally, after this issue you would think to contact some kind of customer service to get the issue solved which I attempted, however instacart literally has ZERO customer service options. No phone line available to speak with someone, email? well you just get a generic auto reply that directs you to the app to chat via text. Well I go the app to chat and guess what? I’m number 5,000 + in line to chat! After leaving the chat open for about 10 hours, I get no response and it actually kicks me out of the chat! Unbelievable! So, I’m fed up with no food, and 135 dollars practically stolen from me, with no resolution in sight. IS THIS HOW YOU RUN A BUSINESS! Finally, I just resorted to calling my bank (which I was on hold with them for almost 2 hours to get to the clams department) to dispute the charge to get my money back. TAKE MY ADVICE!WRAP A T SHIRT AROUND YOUR FACE, WASH YOUR HANDS AND JUST GO TO THE STORE YOURSELF. INSTACART IS A WASTE OF TIME, MONEY, AND STRESS THAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY DONT NEED. BEWARE! RUN AS FAR AS YOU CAN FROM THEM AND NEVER LOOK BACK!"

She didn’t start ‘shopping’ until after 5:00 pm, so it’s not surprising that many items had to be cancelled. By then the Sprouts store had been cleaned out during the day by fools who were NOT practicing the social-distancing as strongly recommended by Federal, State and Local authorities.The most disturbing thing about this Instacart experience, however, is that three items that she didn’t cancel and refund for being unavailable were not delivered and yet we were billed for them. Adding those to the four that she cancelled and refunded, there were 7 of 18 items (40%) that we ordered, but didn’t get, even though the Sprouts website showed that they were available.      Apparently, person that Insta-cart hired to make this shopping/delivery run didn’t consider it to be a priority. By contrast to this experience, our first experience with another store last week resulted in delivery of 80% of the items we had requested. The goods were delivered in a company truck with a professional driver. He arrived at the stated time and we were not billed for any “ghost” items."

I wasn't told that substitutions would be made and my receipt wasn't altered according to what was actually bought by the shopper. My shopper was a Hispanic man who apparently didn't know how to use the app and began logging everything as 1 lb or just 1 piece while he was shopping which made me wary, and when I called him out on it, he said ""lol my mistake"" and carried on logging things wrong. After receiving my groceries, I found many things damaged and rotten, like an avocado with broken skin like someone put a finger through it. I was horrified especially with the ongoing pandemic that Instacart would not vet who works on their platform.  I immediately reported the issue to Instacart with no response for several days. After sending several emails, a failed chat that closed on its own after 3 hours waiting time after giving me an estimate of 59 minutes, and a phone call to Sprouts for help later, I got an email from Instacart saying that they will give me $4 in credit to use on my next Instacart purchase. $4 doesn't even cover one of the several items that never arrived, and I have no intent to use them ever again given their poor service, lack of quality control, and business practices that are akin to thievery. Instacart is not a reputable business, does not care what kind of thieves or low-lives work on their platform, and does not take care of their customers. I don't recommend that anyone use them."

I wish that I had seen this site before using them. Like others who have posted here, I had a recent bad experience with using Instacart and haven't received my order despite my account indicating that my order has been delivered. It's really feeling like this might be a scam. In a nutshell, I ordered from Instacart yesterday afternoon. Instacart indicated that they could get my order to me within two hours so I was THRILLED (as most of you know, it's literally impossible to get deliveries within a few days or even weeks due to the current COVID-19 crisis). The shopper texted me from the store and indicated that there were two items that were unavailable, which didn't seem strange to me because the stores are out of A LOT of items right now. The shopper and I went back and forth a few times over text because I wanted to know what my options were and there weren't many choices. I texted the shopper that it was fine to get a generic brand or anything else that was similar to the product that I had originally ordered. By this point, we're almost 2 hours into when I originally placed the order. Then, I get a message that the shopper is on their way to my house and immediately after that I get another message stating that they delivered the order (how is it possible that they were on the way and delivered the order at the same time? I figured the shopper might have done both at the house or it might be a glitch in the app or something else). Anyway, I was home so I immediately went to the door and my order was NOT there. Similar to other people on this site, I looked around the house and there is nothing. I also looked in the mailbox which is extra-large so that you can fit packages in there and NOTHING. I immediately texted the shopper who I had just been texting with to let them know that they went to the wrong address and the system blocks me from communicating with the shopper (I guess the program is set up that communication stops after delivery which makes sense to me but not if there is a problem; we could have remedied the problem immediately if the shopper was actually at the incorrect location). I immediately call the number for Instacart and I can't get a rep on the phone and a message from them states that I need to contact them through the app. I go to the chat box to explain what transpired and there is no response. I leave the chat box open all night long and there is still no response the next day. I just received a message from Instacart (like others) that they rescheduled the delivery without my permission and the delivery is now slated for ""Wed-Mon"" (no specific day or time given!). Looking at many of these reviews, now I'm worried that I won't get the delivery and will be charged for it. Mind you I gave the shopper a good tip because they were able to shop so quickly. I don't understand how the shopper could have delivered it to the wrong address. I'm in a location that is densely populated with clear street signs everywhere in a house that is easily identifiable even without GPS. I'm really disappointing with Instacart because I had high hopes for this service but it's clear to me that there are some glitches in their program that need to be worked out. I won't use them again until they can sort all of this out."

I was charged for items I never ordered nor ever received. The woman's name of the driver who shopped and delivered was Shenika B. I feel stolen from, this is theft no other way to describe it. It's no different than someone taking my credit card walking in a store and buying things for themselves without my permission!!!!!!!!! Again the drivers name is Shenika B. and if she is stole from me, she is most likely stealing from others if not every customer she shops for. Again I'm repeating her name Shenika B. She is stealing from customers. This review is from Racine, Wisconsin"

At 5:49 pm on the 3rd a person who identified themselves as Alexis P texted us and said she was starting to fill our order. Over the next hour she continued to contact us saying what she could or couldn't find and what she was substituting for some of the items that were out. At 6:46 she texted and said she would be on the way and should arrive in 20 minutes. That evening I tried to contact Instacart only to be told there was a 389 minute wait until I might be able to talk to someone. I didn't wait.She never arrived and she did not respond to texts asking what was going. The next day I contacted the store she had been shopping at. I was told they had no connection with Instacart and I would need to contact them for help. I called the Kroger help line and was told the same information. I called Instatacart and waited this time about an hour until I could speak to someone. The woman I spoke to said she would contact Kroger and tell them to refund my money. She also said someone from Kroger would contact me the next day by phone or by e-mail. Three days later there has been no contact.At this point clearly the three customer service people I have spoken have lied to me.  When I checked my bank statement I saw Fred Meyer had with drawn the money from my checking account, and in fact it was the Fred Meyer which I had called and was told they had nothing to do with Instacart.At this point I consider Instacart and Kroger to be running a continuing criminal enterprise. Kroger sends people to Instacart from the Fred Meyer app thus appearing to a reasonable person to be vouching for their service. Kroger thru Fred Meyer then gets the victim's money while deny having anything to do with Instacart. Instacart says they will tell Kroger to refund the victim's money, which it appears they do not do.As a result I have contacted our bank and disputed the charge. I filed a theft report with the local police department and will be e-mailing the state Attorney General's consumer protection division with a complaint.I will never do business with these companies again."

At first everything seemed great. I got some text messages about the progress of filling my order, authorized a few substitutions, and got an estimated delivery time for that morning. Then it all fell apart spectacularly.I received a message stating ""hurray, your order has been delivered!"" Except, of course, it most certainly had not. I immediately texted back to say ""hey, whatever you delivered was to the wrong address"", only to get a message stating that I couldn't reply to the text messages I had received. Ok, tried calling customer support. Nope, customer support recorded message just says they no longer do phone based customer support. Ok, how about their site? I selected the form option that said my order had not been received and got a canned reply that they were very busy but a customer support agent would jump on the chat soon. 5 hours later and nothing. By now I'm fuming; there's no way I'm paying $270 (about my total charges) for a non-existent ""service"". Called my credit card company to dispute the charges, only to find that Instacart had cancelled the order themselves.So I get to keep my money, but what a COMPLETE waste of time and effort. How in the world does this company stay in business with such an absurdly chaotic and unreliable process? From the VAST numbers of complaints, it seems like it's hit or miss that any order gets completed at all, wasting their shopper's time and resources, the customers time and resources, and, I'm guessing, piles of investor money. Whoever is running this poop show (swear word replaced, but you know what I mean) should be fired and replaced with someone with an ounce of competence.And frankly, I'm not sympathetic to the ""but it's so busy right now"" argument. Creating order from the chaos of high demand is literally what they are being paid for. If it only works when there is an orderly stream of demand the shoppers could just go into business for themselves and fulfill orders directly with customers. Optimizing that work flow and keeping everything running smoothly is their whole business model, and they are failing miserably. You want to see it done right, look at Amazon. They are also getting slammed by massive increases in demand, but they kept it under control by efficiently slicing the demand into different levels of priority and adjusted delivery time expectations to make sure the important stuff (mostly) gets through quickly while less important orders might have to take a bit longer to fulfill. Is it perfect? No, of course not. But it's still functional, while as far as I can see Instacart is crumbling into chaos at the expense of their shoppers and serious unhappiness of customers, while the company adopts a ""who cares, plenty of customers right now"" attitude towards it all."

If I am understanding the app correctly, it costs $99 annually to join.  After investing 2 hours in trying to correct the problem, I finally gave up.  They can keep the $40.

I removed my credit card from my newly opened account. Finally, site shows order has been cancelled.My grocery items total was $198.00. Then a service fee was charged ($3.99). Then a delivery fee was charged ($13.00). Then a mandatory tip of 5% was added ($10 and change), with the recommendation I increase this tip. This brings the total to $240 change for my $198.00 bill.  THEN an additional $35 fee was added. When I looked into this additional fee, I was informed on Instacart website that prices may not be in finality as they are indicated on grocery store site (evidencing blatant and undisclosed price gouging on the part of Instacart), and there are videos available from other reviewers expaining that I would be charged per mile for delivery (Instacart selected a Safeway location downtown, when I live precisely .5 mile from a closer Safeway--this is also demonstrable). Instacart itself does not disclose this additional delivery fee. So my $198 (including tax) grocery total is suddenly $275. My credit card was then charged an ADDITIONAL $275 AFTER I cancelled this order REPEATEDLY, for a total of $550 for NO ITEMS,  NO SERVICES, and demonstrably CANCELLED ORDER.There is no way a business can charge you repeatedly for demonstrably cancelled goods or services. (Screenshots of website and texts confirm cancelled order.) I will be contacting Fraud Department at my bank to dispute charges. This case is so extreme, there may be legal implications.This incident and the $550 charged to my credit card would be stressful for anybody. But additionally so for me, as I have an autoimmune disease and have been advised not to go shopping during the COVID-19 pandemic. My household consists of three adults currently unemployed due to conditions of the pandemic. How any business can profit from the situation is abhorrent in itself, but to charge for items not delivered and services not rendered is outright theft."

Obviously, I didn’t have time to go back and reorder everything and send it again in 1 min, and I don’t need double milk, bananas, cheese etc... he put me on hold came back to tell me he couldn’t refund it, and asked if I received the groceries? I said yes, but I don’t want them! I’ll gladly return them!! I informed him I’m not paying $110 for a double order I didn’t order, that’s not my fault, and a glitch on your end! He put me on hold again, because he said “this is a difference of opinion, and he didn’t know what to do” then 15 min later on hold I was hung up on and then sent a text from a number I am unable to respond to that says “we have given you a refund as a one time courtesy. It will be credited to your account within 3-5 days.” didn’t tell me what was being refunded! Was it the $110 double charge, was it the $160 random charge!! He could of easily came back on the line and told me that, but no he was tired of dealing with me!!

I filed a credit card dispute with the bank. They are a joke. Please, do not do business with these thieves. Beware of instacart. I thought I was saving myself time and effort during this pandemic by joining instacart. In return I am being fraudulently charged on my credit card and offered no customer service or reply. I will not do business with instacart again. If I could give a negative triple 0 squared review I would. They are a pitiful company taking advantage of customers during a pandemic. Since I feel this way as a customer, imagine their poor employees. I thought I would try something new in the 21st century to make life easier. So done with them. Save yourself grief and time.  Forget about using their useless service."

All day, it's said that Fred is shopping, and the delivery day/time has changed. I cannot cancel or modify the order. When I call the wait time is over an hour and no one ever picks up. When I sent an email, no one responded, and the ""report a problem"" button on the app just takes you to the order, no place at all to report the problem. This seems like a scam to me.

In addition to these charges, there is an ""upcharge"" added to each item ordered, which means that you're paying more than the regular online price established by the vendor, e.g., Sam's Club.2.  There is no receipt provided at the time of delivery to reconcile the charged items with those actually delivered.  In my particular case, items were charged, but not delivered.3.  After discovering the discrepancies associated with my order and delivery, I reported the problem online; however, at the time of this review, which is a day later, I have received no correction to the charge and no response from Instacart.As a result of the aforementioned issues, I will NOT be utilizing Instacart again.

When I finally talked to an employee she informed me that she could not tell me when my delivery would arrive because they didn't have a shopper available in my area. I asked to speak to her supervisor and was told that it would not be possible because she did not know who her supervisor was. I cancelled my order and requested a confirmation email. That was when I found out that they had added an additional $18 to the price on my original order. Giving them one star if far to generous. I will also make my dissatisfaction known to Kroger corporate management. They should not let a lousy subcontractor represent their store.  Dave G"

I try to chat with my shopper and no response (like 2 hour no response) so I call Instacart- states wait time is 120 minutes- so annoying but I wait it out... 3 HOURS and 37 MINUTES later, it is my turn... no one talks... 5 more minutes of me saying “Hello?!?” and they HANG UP on me!!!! Livid! So I chat with a CSR for Costco- nothing they can do since instacart has not assigned a order number. I am currently on hold with Instacart again- states hold time is 72 minutes (yeah right). While I wait, I might as well heavy finger review this joke of a company. Lesson learned and will never use this service again. Disclaimer: I know this is a hard time for these companies and am very understanding but the way this system is set up is the problem... the line of communication is the problem. I have waited 5 days for this order, if Instacart communicated to me that they are behind, I would have understood... instead I have a huge amount being held in my bank account for an order that I have no way of knowing status or what I am going to receive?!?

Call about 8:07 .....I'm still on hold it's now 9:23pm and..it's now too late for me to place the order because they close at 10. Can't place an order elsewhere Because of limited time and the funds were charged to my card so I don't have room.  My trial ends in two days. I WONT be getting a membership.  No other shopper ever has done this, when we used Shipt, EVER. Our house is very easy and less than three min from Meijer parking lot. Like two streets down. It's a little over two minutes actually. I guess I will be buying a shipt membership. Idk if she couldn't read or if she stole them. All I know is they sure as hell better give me my dang money back!!!!!!  You can't communicate with your shopper once they are on the way either. Horrible customer service, worst ever. And here I Sit at 9:30....still on hold no dang groceries and I paid like $68."

In addition to a few other items, ordered 10 cans each of three different canned goods, but the store had a limit of 4 cans for each type of canned good. The shopper did not make the appropriate adjustments, and I was charged for the additional 18 items (meaning I was charged $10 more than I should have been charged) on my final receipt. I reported an issue with my order in the app, and received an email stating ""someone will be in contact with you shortly""; no one has been in contact with me yet. I also attempted to contact Instacart both via the in-app chat option as well as over the phone 5 different times over the span of two days. I never received a reply via the two in-app chats I attempted; when I phoned the first time, I was on hold for an hour and a half and then my call was disconnected. The second time I called, I was on hold for 2 hours and again my call was disconnected. I then ""scheduled a time"" to have Instacart call me. When the call came in at the scheduled time, I was placed on hold; I was on hold for 45 minutes and, yet again, my call was disconnected. I have never encountered such poor service both in terms of the order itself and in terms of customer service. I understand that this is a difficult time and many delivery services are being pushed to their limits, but this degree of carelessness is unacceptable. I, at the very least, expected that when I scheduled a phone call, a representative would be available and ready to assist me. It's not the $10 that matter, it's the fact that Instacart's service, in my experience, is entirely unreliable. If an order cannot be fulfilled correctly, AND there is no means of rectifying the issue, what exactly is the point of this service? I find this especially frustrating at a time like this, when people have limited options and limited funds. My experience with Instacart has been an absolute disaster, and I will neither be utilizing the service again nor recommending the service to others. If I could give my experience with Instacart a rating below zero, I would."

After several exchanges with their “customer service,” they said to reinstate my acct I had to pay them back the $27 that they stole from me plus a $15 processing fee. You can guess what I said."

I checked with my Mother in law only to find out she had not received it. No idea where the order is or what happened to it.

So at 9:30 a.m. I went on line registered for Superstore on line shopping then I was told since I wanted my order delivered I had to register with instacart, which I did.  Then I went back to S.Store clicked on ""order to be delivered by instacart"" & scrolled down until I found a delivery time of next Tuesday (a week away) I figured, well that's just the way it is. Then I began my shopping.  now I am not the most savvy person on a computer, so it took me all morning & most of the afternoon to figure out how to get my usual products that I normally buy.  When I was finished my shopping I went to check out my cart  & was prompted to select a pick-up time.  I immediately knew this was wrong as I had already selected a delivery time, so I phoned Superstore on their contact number.  I was on hold for 41 minutes until an rep answered.  He informed me that I have the wrong extension, but he would connect me to the proper one. I was put on hold for another 17 minutes, only find out from this rep that Superstore has nothing to do with instacart & that I would have to call their 1-888 number, which I did.....I got put on hold again.   A voice told me my wait time was 51 minutes, not too happy but I waited what else could I do.  I had an order on my computer screen that I could not finish with out starting all over again. At the 31 minute mark the voice came on overriding the hold music informing me that me wait time is now 43 minutes..So I wait..At the one hour mark of waiting I was informed that my wait time is now 51 minutes again.  This continued for the next hour every time I would get close to the end of my wait time I was informed that I would wait even more.  Finally at 2 hours & 11 minutes a voice came on to inform me that my wait time is 14 minutes...finally I though..It's gonna be over soon...Three minutes & several seconds later there was a click the music stopped & I got a busy signal.  I very loudly cursed instacart several times while I frantically keep clicking the connect button on my phone.  This only receive a dial tone. If I had any other choice of getting my groceries, I would inform instacart where they could shove their delivery & customer service.  I know everyone is so busy with the virus scare & that everyone has to take precautions as well..but why does Instacart not install a ""Call you back at this number"" service when the know they have people on hold for such long periods.  It is now 8:23 pm & I still haven't ordered my groceries..BAD BAD BAD SERVICE Those people who are unable to pick up their food due to mobility problems should have some sort of priority sequence over those that are just panicking...but in this age of.......

The problem is that I was never reimbursed for all the products that I did not receive. I have emailed them 3 times. I will never use instacart again or Shaws Market.

I ordered from a store and before the shopper started shopping my items I wanted to add another item to my list. I followed the instructions in the FAQs to add an item and it ended up duplicating my order. So that is the first problem...got charged twice for the order. The second problem is that one shopper tried to cancel the extra order for me and couldn't. The second shopper that actually shopped my items either stole my groceries or delivered them somewhere else. So I paid for 2 grocery lists full of items and got NOTHING for it. The guy marked in the app that he delivered to my house and I was right there. He didn't!!! I tried to call instacart and there was a 2 hour hold, but I decided to do it while playing games with my kids. After 2 hours someone goes to answer my call AND THEY DISCONNECTED THE CALL!!...before I could ever talk to the person. I have sent 5 emails and no one responds so now I will blast them with bad reviews until someone from instacart gets in touch with me to make this right! Beware when you use instacart!!!!!!"

I waited since I was working. However, after 2 hours of waiting, I didn't get a response so I ended the chat.

I wish I had read online reviews before using Instacart. The way it is intertwined on Fred Myers (Krogers) website, I thought Fred Myer's employees were doing the work and that Instacart was an online check-out system. Instacart needs a class action lawsuit against it. The companies that willingly partner with Instacart hold some responsibility for providing victims."

Two experiences with Instacart militated for my second review. With the reviewer who wishes that s/he could give zero stars, I agree.I recently had surgery on one foot (to be followed up by the same procedure on the other foot) and have been homebound for 5 weeks. The supplies I put in prior to the surgery finally ran out and I decided to try Instacart: how perfect it seemed, to have someone shop and deliver my groceries when I could not leave my home. Shop #1 was a disappointment because the shopper made substitutions for items for which no substitution was necessary. Shop #2 was a disaster to put it mildly. The shopping did not take place as scheduled by me; items were simply dropped from the list; substitutions were again made for items for which a substitution was unnecessary; and the substitutions clearly seem to have been made for the convenience of the Instacart shopper: if s/he did not recognize my item, it seems clear that the shopper chose something close to it.In addition, I placed my Shop #2 order on a Wednesday. I watched as, daily, the pick-up date was pushed forward by one day. I finally received my Wednesday order the following Monday - 5 days later than when I needed it!I want also to note that the ""customer service"" at Instacart is very nearly non-existent. Of the four different customer service representatives I had to speak to in order to get my Shop #2 released, not one was especially pleasant to deal with. The fourth individual would profit from a course in customer relations: allow the customer to explain the problem; what has been done to rectify it if anything; and speak to the customer with respect. The woman who spoke to me was edgy, borderline defiant, and downright sarcastic.I am sure there are really effective shopping / delivery services out there. Sadly, Instacart apparently is not one. Infuriating, simply infuriating."

The concept is GREAT the execution is HORRIBLE. Instacart is not a cheap service.  You are tipping, paying premium prices for products, a service fee and a delivery fee.  My first order went smoothly and I thought, ""This is going to be a great relationship!"".  From there, it went downhill.  I've had hundreds of dollars of groceries left outside my house unattended an hour prior to scheduled drop off (and me not home).  I've had groceries show up an hour later than the scheduled drop off.  The one constant, is the lack of consistency in getting what I order.  It's AMAZING how every shopper never gets the order right.  My most recent order I was billed for an item that should have been twice the size than the item I actually received and the shopper thought a replacement that cost THREE TIMES MORE was a good idea.  Infact, that ONE item totalled by itself half my bill!  Then had the audacity to say they couldn't get half my items because you know, coronavirus (apparently sweet potatoes and coffee cream are hot pandemic commodities). Instacarts solution?  Credit me $4.77!  What an insult! If you don't mind not knowing when your groceries will show up, never getting the items you requested, being billed for items you didn't receive and leaving your list in the hands of someone who probably still has their mom buying their groceries, instacart would be a great fit for you. I have now opted to go with either grocery gateway or metro.  The downside is the aren't available to deliver in 2 hours, but the last few times I used their service, my products were spot on, quality and delivered on time."

I never asked someone to change my order date and time again. Customer service was nice, but extremely terrible and passive aggressive with a nice creepy lying attitude. Supervisors and associates told me different information and did things to my order I never asked them to do. REALLY REALLY BAD. Other times I've had bad experiences, but not this bad!

Wednesday to Thursday and then Thursday to Saturday. I'm going tomorrow myself and getting my groceries. I'll probably try to avoid using InstaCart, though it is a convenience. Hopefully there is a competition company, so they don't try to do what they did to me today.

Unfortunately, I have tried ordering 2 times since then only to be very disappointed. One shopper completed my entire order just to disappear with it and never showed up, requiring a time-consuming call to customer service. Although they reassigned the order to a different shopper that evening, she charged me for more expensive items but delivered less expensive items, which required yet another call to customer service. Today was my last time trying to use Instacart in Columbus, Mississippi. My order was placed and then received, but never a response from the shopper. Again, this led to another call to customer service. I asked if they could just assign my order to Ashley, the shopper from my initial experience, but that was not possible.

MEANWHILE, THE HAD ALLEGEDLY CHECKED OUT, AND I WAS TOLD (through yet another text) NO CHANGES COULD BE MADE TO THE ORDER.  I WAS DENIED A CHANCE TO REVIEW MY ORDER/2. THEN  A CONTRADICTORY  MESSAGE PINGED MY PHONE WHICH STATED THAT I STILL HAD TIME TO ADD ITEMS.  I ATTEMPTED TO DO SO, BUT THOSE ITEMS WENT TO A DIFFERENT CART.  I WAS CHARGED, AND THE THE GROCERIES WERE PROMPTLY DELIVERED BY YET ANOTHER SHOPPER.AT ABOUT 6:30 PM..3. SO WHERE DID THE FIRST SHOPPER GO WITH MY GROCERIES???4.  MY PHONE HAS BEEN BLOWING UP WITH SMS MESSAGES ALL EVENING, AT LEAST 30.AT 7:19 PM  ANTANIKA ""STARTED SHOPPING"" ACCORDING TO AN SMS MESSAGE.  5.  ANTANIKA TEXTED ME AT 7:50 P.M. TO SAY THAT ""THEY"" WANTED ME TO APPROVE A CHANGE SHE MADE.  THERE WAS NO PLACE TO APPROVE A CHANGE ON THE APP AT THAT TIME.  NORMALLY THERE IS.   SO I TEXTED HER RIGHT BACK AND SAID NO, I DO NOT WANT DRIED CRANBERRIES. (Originally, I'd ordered dried cherries.)  SHE RECEIVED MY ANSWER WITHIN SECONDS.HER RESPONSE TO ME ""I CHECKED OUT ALREADY"".WHAT!?!?  WHY DID SHE BOTHER ASKING?5.  STILL NO GROCERIES ARRIVED, AND THERE WAS NO MAP TO VIEW ON THE APP, AGAIN, AS USUALLY YOU CAN TRACK THE DRIVER EN ROUTE.  NOTHING. 8. 8:46 PM, I RECEIVE YET ANOTHER SMS MESSAGE.  ""BRYAN F"" IS SHOPPING YOUR ORDER""  WHAT THE HELL?  WHERE WAS ANTANIKA AND THE SECOND (technically the third) CHECKED OUT ORDER?7.   MORE MESSAGES FOLLOWED.  9:07 PM  ""BRYAN F""  REPLACED JIF CREAMY PEANUT BUTTER"".  WITH WHAT??? AND WHY IS ""BRYAN F"" SHOPPING MY ORDER AGAIN.  THAT MADE A TOTAL OF THREE SHOPPERS, NOT INCLUDING THE LADY WHO SHOPPED THE ADDED ITEMS.IT IS NOW 9:30 P.M., AS OF THIS WRITING..  I AM HUNGRY..  I HAVE THE FLU.  MY PETS ARE STARVING.  WHERE ARE MY BLOODY GROCERIES?????I HAVE SCREENSHOTS OF EVERYTHING, AND i WILL MOST DEFINITELY REPORT THE INCIDENT TO MY BANK TOMORROW.  THREE PEOPLE CHECKED OUT MY ORDER, AND I WILL DEMAND THAT ANY EXCESSIVE CHARGES BE REVERSED.  THIS IS FRAUD, AND IF FORCED TO, I WILL TAKE IT TO THE NEXT STEP, THOUGH I SUSPECT MY BANK WILL INVESTIGATE THE INCIDENT..EDITED TO ADD:  ""BRYAN f"" FINALLY SHOWED UP AT ABOUT 10:00 P.M.  I HAD SHUT OFF THE PORCH LIGHT AND LIVING ROOM LAMPS, AND WAS DETERMINED NOT ACCEPT THE ORDER.  BUT WITH FOUR PAIRS OF SAD, HUNGRY EYES STARING BACK AT ME, I FINALLY RELENTED.  BESIDES, I WAS AFRAID THAT HE MIGHT DUMP THEM AND LEAVE, ANYWAY.  I  EXPRESSED MY ANGER, AND STATED THAT SHOULDN'T EXPECT A TIP.  HE SAID THAT ANTANIKA HAD AN EMERGENCY,  SUDDENLY?  AFTER SHE TOLD ME SHE HAD COMPLETED CHECKING OUT?  i WASN'T THERE SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT TRANSPIRED..  PERHAPS SHE WAS SICK, OR HAD A FAMILY EMERGENCY.. IN THAT CASE, HOWEVER,, A SUPERVISOR SHOULD HAVE INFORMED ME PROMPTLY, AND MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO HAVE THE GROCERIES DELIVERED ASAP..  WHY DID ""BRYAN f"" HAVE TO SHOP MY ORDER ALL OVER AGAIN?  FOR THE THIRD TIME?  I WAS INCLINED TO GIVE ""BRYAN F"" THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT, BUT AS HE WALKED AWAY, HE YELLED INSULTING WORDS BACK AT ME.  SO PFFT!  NO SOUP FOR HIM.  FOR THE RECORD, I LODGED A COMPLAINT ON INSTACART'S WEBSITE HOURS AGO, INCLUDING MY PHONE NUMBER AND EMAIL ADDRESS.  THE SITE STATES THAT COMPLAINTS WILL BE ADDRESSED VIA A PHONE CALL WITHIN TWO HOURS..  I'M NOT HOLDING MY  BREATH.  BUT INSTACART MANAGEMENT BEST BEWARE IF I FIND DUPLICATE CHARGES OR DISCREPANCIES IN MY BANK ACCOUNT TOMORROW WHEN THE TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN RECONCILED AND POSTED."

I have dealt with many delivery services and will always going forward remember that Instacart is the service to never use again. The mistakes they made with my order was not the first time and their lack of customer service in resolving in favor of the customer is their policy. I paid them an extra $14.99 in the app to deliver my groceries and their response when making a mistake was to redeliver the missing product later and give me a $5 credit towards a future delivery. How on earth does that make the customer feel whole. Especially when this was not the first time that made this type of error. The credit is useless when you don’t ever plan to use their service again. Upon further contemplation, regarding time and actual services rendered, that they actually stole my money. GOING FORWARD I WILL WARN ALL INCLUDING THE COMPANIES THAT ARE USING THEM TO AVOID AT ALL COSTS. They are outdated in their customer service, delivery systems and are a RIP-OFF!"

Second order was fine. Third, system was down and even when I went inside the store myself to pick up the items that I had already been charged for, they couldn’t “release” my items to me. Because of this I was given a $10 credit to try again. Guess what?  My order time was 6-7 pm. Received a text at 6:40 saying I needed to call customer service to reschedule. I rescheduled reluctantly for 8-9. When the window of pickup was nearly closed I called customer service again and was told that my order could not be filled.

Through the app I got notice my shopper started shopping at 9:34 am. I had 19 items. Well I checked back at 10:22 am and she still hasn’t picked up any of my items....odd seeing it was a small order and it had been almost an hour. I checked back again at 10:41 am and she had 3 items. Mind you this was supposed to be delivered by 11. Needless to say 11 am comes and goes. Now it’s 11:15. Nothing, I sent the shopper a message, no response. 11:24 I contact instacart customer service by chat. Horrible customer service. Basically told me I should be okay with the late order because it was coming. So I figured calling and speaking to someone would help. Nope same attitude. However this time I was given the $4.24 service fee back (WOW). Now the time is almost noon. The shopper finally shows up. When my son mention she was late she was rude, gave multiple excuses, one being she had two orders....I’m sorry but her inability to manage time and multitask shouldn’t end up being my problem. Maybe grocery shopping is too hard for her. Anyways and the cherry on the top was she had her children with her. I know this is not allowed by instacart. Not only did she have them she let them run around my yard and play while she gave my son our groceries. Now this is unacceptable if one of those kids was hurt on my property guess whose problem that would. Mine. Not cool. I do not feel instacart handled this well. They didn’t seem to care that my order was technically an hour and a half late."

Finally talked to Jasmine at Instacart and was told that delivery person could not locate my address (GPS ANYONE?!?) I had provided my phone number for this order but never heard word one.  Jasmine told me that she could not reach the delivery person to attempt to redeliver (Shouldn't one who does deliveries for a company answer their phone?). THEY HAD MY PHONE NUMBER!!!Jasmine got Wegman's on the phone to find out how they could ""help"". The person at Wegman's couldn't even look up the order.  She needed to involve her manager and no one there seemed to know how to handle any of this.  It was if the employees and management didn't know that Wegman's and Instacart were in a partnership.  The only indication that the two companies were working together is that my order was prepared by someone named Brooke at Wegman's.Note: I recieved several texts from Wegman's during my order's process.Apparently Wegman's couldn't attempt re-delivery, I have to place the order again (after Instacart processes a refund of course)!!!!

See I’m just the in store shopper meaning someone else delivers the order and whatever review they get reflects on me too and that’s not fair that I can’t trust the delivery driver to deliver all the bags and items to these customers. Also for you customers ordering groceries, if you know that something is BOGO make sure you are putting you want 2 of that item. Because as the shopper if you only have one I am only allowed to get you one and no more even if it is bogo, I cannot add another one because the instacart app will just charge you for two and not give you the special.

But after receiving my groceries I see the store receipt in my bag. My groceries actually only cost $97, not the estimated $122. I contacted them about this. Apparently any sale items, or incorrectly priced items, benefit Instacart and NOT THE BUYER. I asked them to please adjust my grocery total amount from $122 to $97. They would not. They are absolute THIEVES. This is a $25 difference that they are pocketing on top of all the fees I already paid. I will NEVER use this service again.

If you look the items up individually through the search engine on Instacarts site it doesn't tell you the item is out of stock with the item grayed out like it should. You have to go to your items tab and discover it's out of stock by chance. There have been orders where important items that we needed are refunded because they are out of stock. Say the item is out of stock everywhere not in only one part of the site. Don't allow people to add it to their cart when they look these items up via the search engine. Also we pay a monthly fee for free delivery and Instacart tacks more fees on so what's the point of paying a monthly free delivery fee. Twice tonight I've had to call and complain. We received Ginger Ale instead of Mt Frost and received milk that expires tomorrow. They redelivered the two items giving us a soaked case of Mt Frost and another jug with an expiration date of tomorrow like the last jug of milk. The second milk jug was slimy and looked like it was set down in the wet grass

I have a 9 month old infant and this would be a fantastic service to be able to use but they will not deliver to my address. I figured hell, I’ll call up and see if there is a way of getting the service brought out to my address. Now I wouldn’t be so angry if I didn’t get such bad customer service. Instacart will deliver to both my parents and in laws who live 30 minutes from any one of these grocery stores. You literally have to make two right turns and a left turn to get from this grocery store to my house in less then 10 minutes but they will not deliver to my address. So when I called the first time it was an Indian male who spoke broken English... he never asked me my name, phone number or email to see my account. He was very rude to me and I was very polite as I was trying to get them to come out to my house. He said “your zip code?” Gave him my zip code. “Can I have your address or something?”I gave him all the information I could give him even though he seemed as if I was inconviencing him. So he told me that they only come out to “some rural areas”. That was the answer I got. I figured I’d call again because it seemed as if I was inconviencing this man and then an Indian women answered the phone. Much more polite asked me for all my information and when we got to the end it was the same answer.... we don’t deliver there but we are expanding. No one could tell me why that I live in the same town as this grocery store less then 10 miles and 10 minutes away they won’t deliver to me. They deliver to two other towns 2 towns away 20+minutes from the store but will not deliver or even tell me when this service will become available to me.

However, for the SAME cart that I did twice in both app (PC Express for pick-up and PC Delivery), the first cart came to 169,67$ and the other one, 214$. Remove the 10$ tip and 3,99$, and add the 15$ off coupon I got, it basically cancels each other. the difference is 45$ FOR THE SAME ITEMS IN THE SAME STORE.

I received all the pop up for the substitution, but since the app wasn’t working, I couldn’t accept them or not, except for two that worked. I use the in-store pick up quite often and there is never more than 2-3 substitutions on my order. I was once again shocked on the amount of substitution alerts I got.4. Delivery.

Then my order didn’t get delivery before 4:50 without any updates that the time change.Still not able to see if we got everything, the final amount or the substitutions.

After a friend highly recommended their service, I decided to try it for the very first time in Oldsmar, Florida (suburb of Tampa) when my family and I were traveling there on vacation and staying in a condo with a kitchen. Our flight was scheduled to arrive in mid-evening, so I thought it would be a great idea to have the week's groceries delivered that same evening so we'd have dinner ingredients pretty much right when we got there and breakfast ingredients for the next morning. When our plane landed, I received a text that the delivery would be delayed by an hour, which I was a bit disappointed about, but figured we would still be ok. The thing is THE GROCERIES NEVER SHOWED UP THAT NIGHT, and I had to reach out to Instacart because they never sent any more correspondence that evening even when the delivery was well past the scheduled arrival time. We ended up ordering a pizza to tide us over, setting us back an unanticipated $35. I reached out to Instacart, who said they'd deliver the order by noon the next morning, so we rearranged our entire next day to accommodate...and by 12:30pm WE STILL HAD NO GROCERIES. Finally I called and cancelled the entire order, we went out for lunch (because my family was starving!

A little before 4pm, I received notification on the app that Rose was pulling my order, but when I looked at the app 30 minutes later, less than half the items had been pulled and Rose was no longer working on completing my order. Forty minutes later, an unknown person on the app was proceeding with processing my order, but then stopped. More time passes and then I get a notice via email that my order will now be an hour late, but would be still be arriving. Ninety minutes after my second delivery window passed, I got a call from the shopper saying that they cancelled my order because the store closed at 3pm, which is not true (store was closing at 7pm, not 3pm) and extremely inconvenient because at that late hour, I had no other options to buy our holiday meal from anywhere else, as every grocery store was closed by the time I got notice of the cancellation. My husband also missed three hours of work today, waiting for a delivery that never showed up. He lost wages waiting extended hours for this order to arrive. If the order was going to be cancelled, the notification should have been given much sooner to allow for alternate plans to be made and my husband would not have lost money by leaving work to wait for the delivery, but instead they began my order, then delayed my order, making us think it was still coming, only to cancel it almost three hours after my original delivery time. For my “convenience” the order was rescheduled for the day after Christmas, which is not convenient because I needed it in time for our holiday meal, so I had to cancel the order completely, leaving us with absolutely nothing for our family’s holiday dinner and no means to remedy the situation. To compensate me for the issue, I was offered a $10 credit, which doesn’t help my situation at all. After this extremely negative experience, I will never use this service again as it is clearly disorganized, unreliable and relays dishonest information to customers. This resolution and the way this issue was handled is unacceptable and a very poor and inconsiderate display of customer service. If Publix stays affiliated with instacart as their delivery method, I will no longer shop there.

Decided to try with the superstore.  Well, instacart cancelled that as suspicious. I could not log back in with the password that had previously worked and was stored in my iphone password lists.  Got an email about resetting.  Through my multiple attempts to sign on the message varied between bad email and bad password.  Finally found a number to call and the guy said the account was frozen and their fraud team would be in touch for more information.   Ok so now my fraud radar was pinging.  They’d send me an email with links asking for information.  Signing up didn't ask a lot of info and payment was apple pay so what other information would they want.  I told him to cancel the account and i wanted an email confirming the cancellation.  Said the fraud team would get me that - yeah.  Went to hang up and i couldn’t!  It was like one of those fraud calls that stay on the line when you go to call the authorities and pretend to be them!  My phone looked like i could call out but i could still hear him.  He eventually hung up and i called a number i know to make sure of the disconnect.  Might be a legit service but so are gas stations and credit card fraud and theft is high at them!

To be honest this is meant to make grocery shopping convenient for people but all I've experienced is a headache afterwards just to make sure I wasn't ripped off. Save yourselves the trouble and just get delivery directly from grocery stores.

Smile, brush it off, and essentially give their customers a big F U.Today, rather reluctantly, I tried the service again, after not bothering since this past August due to many of the reasons already stated. Again, without fail, their shopper neglected to reach out to me when they couldn't find certain items, made adjustments without my consent, and somehow confused cinnamon rolls for biscuits. Instacart put a $100 hold on my card for $50 worth of groceries and won't let me change the tip to a far more appropriate 10 % for such crappy service (I use 20% as a default. It takes a lot for me to tip less than 20%).So I will continue to do my best to NEVER have to rely on Instacart.

My coupons aren't used, my Loyalty card is not used; it's not even allowed. You claim to provide me with coupons and savings, but if I'm not getting the store's discounted price, I'm paying the suggested retail price, which is usually a LOT more, so in the end, I'm really saving nothing by using Instacart. I would save much more money and be able to use my fuel points with my loyalty card, if I go through store to order instead. And if I use their pickup service, then I don't have to pay your delivery and service fees at all.I also want to add that I have learned that you rip off your employees/shoppers. You pay them next to nothing while they slave for hours and wear down their cars and spend their measly earnings on gas/vehicle upkeep. You actually paid them well in the beginning but have since figured out more and more methods of paying them less while making even more money off of their backs. And then recently, if they try and stand up for their rights, you take away their bonuses. I appreciate a 5-star shopper, but now I hear that they don't even get rewarded for being one anymore. As a result, I'm seeing a drop in quality, and I don't blame them. If you're not paying them enough, they're not going to be happy and therefore aren't going to care enough about their jobs to give quality service.You tell your shoppers to not give the customers their receipts. First of all, that's deceitful! But some shoppers don't know this and have given it to me anyway, and when I review these receipts, I can see that I get nothing BOGO, I get none of my coupons, I don't get my fuel points, and the loyalty card being used is not MY number, it's YOUR number. I can see on these receipts that I could have saved $10-20 in most cases... hmmm isn't that funny? That is EXACTLY what my supposedly waived delivery and service fee would have been! So you tell customers if we pay for Express, we're waiving the fees, but we pay nearly full price for everything, so it just puts that money right back on and we're technically paying it after all!I think at one time, Instacart was a great company, but you have since become deceitful and misleading. You treat your employee/shoppers badly, and you cheat your customers by hiding the real truth of what you're charging in the fine print.I'm going to go back to shopping for my own groceries, or using my store's pickup service. There's no way I'm contributing another penny to your company.Save your money. Don't use them. Force them to have no choice but to pay their employees fairly. Shoppers are very often paid less than minimum wage. they are not employees, they are independent contractors, so this is how IC gets away with it. A year or so ago, shoppers went on strike (as is their right), and the bonus they received for having a 5 star rating for 1 week was removed (this was a $100, well-deserved bonus). Recently, they went on strike again on the platform to receive better default tips, and they removed the Quality Bonus, which was a measly $3 for each 5 star rating. Now they get absolutely nothing for receiving or maintaining a 5 star rating. An example of a delivery order they might receive is to drive 10-20 miles to the requested store, shop 56 items, deliver another 5 miles to the customer, bring it to their door with a smile on their face, and for this, Instacart (in this particular example) paid the shopper $7.85! And on top of this, the customer paid no tip up front... maybe they'll pay in cash upon arrival, or add the tip later, but in most cases, they do not.Don't trust this company. they're crooks. If you don't believe me, continue using them, but watch your receipts, pay attention. Shop once in your store with your loyalty card, then once using IC and then compare your savings. I promise you, they're ripping you off."

Try Amazon! INSTACART DOES NOT DESERVE YOUR MONEY!,"I have been using Instacart for a few years. This year, I had been using this service multiple times a month, sometimes twice a week. One thing I noticed is that there was almost always something wrong with my order. The last couple of times I used the service, I see the shopper was replacing my vegan items with non-vegan items. I messaged them and told them not to pick up those items. They did not listen. A few moments after I sent the message, they finished shopping, which prevented me from being able to contact them. This infuriated me. I sent instacart two messages informing them that I no longer wanted the entire order because of how rude and dismissive the shopper was. Then I remembered that I could call them. So I called and let the rep know that I no longer wanted this order.It took almost 30 minutes for me to argue my case as to why I no longer wanted the order. As I was on the phone with the rep, the delivery showed up and was placed outside of my front door. The shopper was gone before I could reject the order. The rep was still on the phone as I discovered the food outside my door. I told him that he needed to send someone to pick up the groceries because I refuse to take them. The person offended me by selecting replacements that were not vegan and not meeting my requests. This person was forcing me to pay for items I would never be able to eat. So I told the guy I would instead give the whole order back and go to the grocery store on my own when I had time.The Instacart rep assured me that I would not be charged, and I could give the groceries away or throw them away if I wanted because I would not be charged for them.Because of this, I gave the groceries away. I still continued to use Instacart for over a month. Then suddenly, I received multiple emails stating that my account had been frozen due to a dispute with my bank.I NEVER FILED A DISPUTE. I trusted that the rep was honest when he stated that I would get a refund.They stated that my account would be reinstated after the dispute was settled. They told me that I had to cancel the dispute and pay for the order, then they would refund the items that I didn't want.I explained to them that I was so furious that I didn't accept the order. So I gave the groceries to a family member. I told them that I didn't dispute but instead was offered a FULL REFUND. The stated that I needed to cancel and pay to get my account reinstated.They also mentioned some other charges from 3-4 months ago that they could not complete. I understood this because I lock my card once I'm done with an order. I always keep my credit cards locked. So if they try to charge after the fact, (tip, price difference, etc.) they won't be able to. I told them that this was my mistake, and they could now charge me for the little 3 or 4 dollars. By the end of the chain of emails, I was told that I owed them 100+ dollars, and until I paid, I would not be able to use the service.I asked for documented proof of this, and I never got clear documented evidence. They typed up a list with dates, and I matched it up to find that I only actually owed a few bucks — not 100. THIS COMPANY IS GREEDY, AND THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE QUALITY OF SERVICE THAT THEY PROVIDE.Instead of punishing me, the shopper is the one who was in the wrong, and they are the ones who should've paid the consequences.Today after a long month of going through this, I get an email from them telling me that they can no longer provide services to me, and to refer to their terms in conditions.SO THEY BASICALLY TRIED TO BULLY ME INTO PAYING FOR GROCERIES THAT I NEVER USED AND DISCONTINUED SERVICES BECAUSE I REFUSED TO PAY."

I called to find out why my paper receipt was so much less than my emailed receipt from instacart and they just told me it was my fee for using their service. What? I pay a monthly fee for using a service and I also tip the driver very well. This was not disclosed by the way they tried to tell me it was but the statement under prices may vary to store to store made no flipping sense! So this hidden fee and it is very hidden not shown to you at all and changes every time you order, is how they make more money. I would not have a problem with paying more in my monthly fee. This is charging you as high as it can on the items at the store before there discounted or set at the price that usually are at. So you never know what you're being charged and they could not tell me who was receiving the extra payment. Nor could they tell me how much it would be every time I shop. It's completely random. Actually it's on every single item I purchased the price was higher through instacart then it was on my receipt. I then explained to the manager that I would not pay for a service that I didn't know what I was paying each time or ever know what I was paying since they don't tell you! She had to agree with me she wouldn't want to do that either. These people should be shut down by the Better Business Bureau. It's basically like having your lawn mowed for you and telling them to help them self to the spare cash in your cupboard. Now if you're like me I'm not always sure how much exactly is in my spare cash can so who knows how much I paid the lawn person or how much they took. And I never will.

You’ll get up to date, if your employees made accurate notes about all the calls I’ve made to you, Instacart, my bank, and credit card company customer service. Recap I had $200 set aside for my family Thanksgiving. I ordered delivery of groceries from Kroger.  I’m a senior citizen and disabled which I can’t drive.  Next I get a text from Instacart they're running 2 hours behind. I chatted with the shopper via of text on substitutions. It went silent for about 45 minutes when I get an email, not text, driver needs gate code. I replied via of text and email 154. I get another email ""Meet shopper outside. He can’t find you.""I go downstairs and the gate was propped open, people were moving, and didn’t see anyone in my small half circle driveway entrance/exit in front of my complex. I text and emailed, ""The gate has been open since 8:30pm, my delivery was so delayed it was around 10:15pm.  I asked the guys moving how long they had the gate open.  Your driver's Was at the wrong property."" Next I get an email my order was cancelled! That was our thanksgiving groceries. I sent 8 emails to customer service with Instacart to bring my order. You put a pending charge of $169.07 on my credit card that wouldn’t drop off for 7-10 days. I called the bank, cc company, you, Instacart starting at 4am day before thanksgiving. I only had available $30 left of credit to buy thanksgiving on my card since $169.07 had been deducted for my delivery the night before.  A Kroger supervisor, heartless, said the best he would do is give me a $50 credit.I was furious for so much deception. The only way I could use the $50 was to get delivery! Forcing me to use you and Kroger again when you already had my $169.07. I didn’t see the credit of $50 on my account so I called Kroger and was told to type in “I have a $50 credit“ on a product instructions for substitutions. I couldn’t spend over $30 because I had to put my cc down again and your rep said you wouldn’t make any charges. After checkout the $50 would be applied. This is what happen. You took the amount of groceries from my cc leaving me with no money to buy thanksgiving and to top it off, you had the audacity to charge me a delivery fee plus driver tip. Subtracted from that “$50 credit”. You didn’t give me $50. It worked out to be around $35. Once again you also put a pending charge on my cc leaving $3 available credit. You stole my family’s thanksgiving.I’m sending this to you on thanksgiving since the only thing I had ingredients to make was a cake and bread in our bread machine. I hope you enjoyed your thanksgiving knowing you stole my family’s thanksgiving. We’re new to Dallas so we don’t have anyone to even help us out. I will be posting this on every social network, Kroger’s and Instacart website reviews, App Store, and sending this scam to channel 4.5 and 8. It is so hard on me when I have 3 sons home from college and can’t give them thanksgiving. I feel so stressed out, anxiety, depressed, like a horrible single parent. This is because, even though both companies knew my money had been blocked for pending, we had no groceries, and we would not have any food for thanksgiving, YOU DID NOTHING! You should feel embarrassed and ashamed of kicking me to the street.I want my money released immediately, something to make up for my family not having thanksgiving except for a cake and loaf of bread, and some type of reprimand to every heartless, horrible customer service employee, like Mary, that I pleaded plus begged to help me, the day before thanksgiving, to just bring me my groceries.  I hope my testimony goes viral on the web and others will share it with all their threads.  It is so unbelievably I can’t believe this happen.  How does your company pay your bills?  What type of consumers use your service?  I posted this on FB and a lot of the comments even added your a horrible company to be employee.  You treat your drivers that do the shopping like bottom drawer individuals.  What’s ironic is it actually you that is bottom drawer.  I’m on a fixed income with 3 sons in college, which still did not help escalate this to any authority to solve this problem. I expect a reply that will rectify all the wrong you did to me for thanksgiving.You should be put out of business.  Here’s a problem solver a child could get right: why didn’t you go get my groceries, since you still had $169.07 pending for you to use, and bring them to me?  I don’t believe you even had a person shopping for me the night before.  Knowing your customer service is the worst, you had already admitted you were running hours behind, I don’t believe you even attempted my delivery.  The whole “you shopping” was made up.  It sure was not because a gate was closed, or your driver didn’t have a GPS.  Another possibility, having gotten so many comments on Facebook, your driver could have just quit their job to burn you since you treat them so bad.  You are such a “wrong”, “worse”, “joke” of a company the possibility’s are endless of who despises and has a payback towards you.  I wonder how many of your bills are in the third and last notice status to keep your lights on.  Regardless there’s something not right because no one can succeed treating other people like what you did to my family, and me, on thanksgiving.May you file for bankruptcy!"

I am disabled and cannot get to the grocery store so they were wonderful to use, that is, ad long as they got my order correct, which didn't happen too often.  My latest experience was my last time with them, ever.  I ordered 3 individual baking potatoes at .79 each.  Instead I received 3 five pound bags of potatoes totaling over 8.00.  when I called I was on hold waiting for over an hour.  Second and third calls the same.  Fourth call I actually got a person, who, after 30 minutes of gathering information, informed me that she could not help, I needed to send an email to customer service.  I sent the email and 2 days later I heard back, telling me I needed to call.  I explained that I did call and they told me to email.  I received a response telling me to call the given number, which was the same one I had been calling.  Needless to say, 2 weeks later, they still have not corrected the error, issued a refund or collected the 15 pounds of potatoes I have going to waste sitting on the counter.  Never again!"

Total rip off,Wish there was an option for quarter or half star. Instacart is a rip off when ordering items by weight. Do not order from Instacart and keyfood. Their costumer service agents are not competent in doing simple math. Worse experience ever. I never received the item i was billed for and never received a credit. I will never order from Instacart again. I ordered fresh turkey breast advertised as $6.99/lb. i ordered 10lbs for a total of $69.90. They delivered a turkey breast of 8lbs at $2.99/lb for a total of $23.92. Where is my difference of $45.98. They refuse to credit me my money. I will take this further because it took a whole day on the phone with their uneducated agents trying to explain the issue and it by the end of the day my blood pressure was elevated and my anxiety level was increased.

It's a scam to it's customers and shoppers to enrich the three founders of the company. They have turn a good company into Postmates. Let's start with the customer they charge you 149 a year or 7.99 per order then they charge higher prices per item then what is listed in store then they add 10% fee to order that they say goes to shoppers but goes straight to the company. For the shopper the Minimum payment is $7 used to be $10 which they always try to pay they tell the customer to tip bare minimum. When I started there was a $3 bonus if the order was early or on time. They got rid of that because too many shoppers were making there bonuses in favor of a $3 bonus for a 5 star customer rating which people rarely do they recently just got rid of the bonus all together.  ON TOP ALL OF THAT INSTACART STEALS TIPS!!! if the shopper has to refund or replace an item. INSTACART WILL SWEAR UP AND DOWN IT WAS A MISTAKE IT'S NOT.  They try to Control the message they want hear in the media that Instacart pays to control but Instacart can't hid from the lawsuit's when the truth comes out.

The only option was delivery on another day or 9pm tonight. Due to my work schedule this is completely unacceptable and I had to cancel the entire order. Another time I had my groceries stolen, where the driver just took my food home and never came. I've had incorrect items delivered numerous times. The customer service phone people are great but the field people who do the delivery and shopping are the worst! The only reason I have used them a few times is because they give me a discount for the next order."

Most notably was last night. This past Friday I set up an order to be delivered Sunday evening for when I got back in town. I had a work event Monday that I needed to bring two dishes for. Not only did Instacart not deliver my groceries but after waiting around for two hours with no groceries or further communication, I had to call them myself to inquire about my grocery status. The only recourse offered was rescheduling my delivery for the next day, at a time after the event had already happened. That’s it, that’s all they offered to make it better. When I asked to speak to a supervisor he told me, in a very monotone voice, that he could only reschedule my groceries and offer me a $10 credit on my NEXT order. As if I would want to use this service again and as if $10 at all makes up for the egregious error. I ended up having to wake up extra early to go buy new groceries myself and put the two dishes together. This is also the SECOND TIME Instacart has left me high and dry without my groceries before a big event. The previous time was for a tailgate I was hosting where yet again I had to wake up early and go do the shopping myself. I cannot understand the lack of professionalism or care for their customers. I can not recommend Instacart to anyone at this point."

Then my shopper started shopping at 10:00 am for an 11:00 am delivery on a $250 order. not sure how that was going to happen.  I received more than a dozen texts from her regarding my order. I thought some of the prices seemed pretty high so I cross referenced on The superstore’s online ordering system. Instacart said they charge 7.5% service fee, $3 for delivery and a 10% tip for the shopper. Parmesan cheese that was $8 on line was $10.95. Coffee that was $9.99 online was $18.99 (Yes, I got the exact same size and brand etc.). Pepperoni that was $11.95 online was $14.95.  So not sure if there was going to be 7.5% on top of these much higher prices as those prices do not reflect 7.5%. After spending all morning texting back and forth with the Shopper, around 12:30 I found out there was a problem at the Superstore with their POS system. I received several texts about it from my shopper. I offered to come down and pay cash and was told to wait until she could talk to Support. Then I got a phone call from Support asking me to hold. I did for several minutes, was cut off and when I called back I was told my order had been suspended and the shopper had left the store 10 minutes earlier. What a waste of time. I won’t use these guys again. Glad I didn’t end up paying the super high prices after all.i went down to the store and there was a sign at the front door that the debit and credit was down and I found out it had been since the day before.I would have thought the Shopper would have figured there would be a problem as soon as they saw the sign. Instacart didn’t offer anything, said they could try putting my order through in a few days again. No thanks!  Very poor communication. Don’t deserve a star at all."

They refunded me for the first time but the second time o called, I was told I was confused and the first time refund was just a courtesy.  The customer service rep tried to explain to me that these are the prices agreed upon between Instacart and the store and sometimes there will be discrepancies.  My question is:  why would the store agree to this if they are not seeing the cash into their account?  What store did Instacart do it’s “cost comparison” with?  If you do the math According to these two receipts and add the $9.99 monthly membership fee, Instacart has already made just under $33 in profit from me in less than a month.  If you shop four times a month with an average $10 markup plus the delivery fee that is $50 a month the company is charging!!!! Is that explained in their advertising or am I just confused again?

At the beginning of 2019, my orders were on time, every single time. It seemed that the person shopping the order was also always the one delivering the order, which seemed to work very well. However this changed at some point and the shopper was separated from the delivery person.The consistent issue I have run into as a result of this is that, while the shopper finishes shopping my order usually within a half hour of ordering, the delivery happens late every single time. I usually get a notification some time within the delivery window that the order is late. This would be okay if it was once in a while, but it happens during every single order now.I select the ""within 2 hours"" whenever it is available. Sometimes it is not available, which signals to me that it is not possible for a delivery within 2 hours...fine, that's logical. However, when this window is available, I expect (as a paying Express member), that there is sufficient shoppers/delivery couriers available to make the order delivery on time.I just cancelled an order today because it was late and I didn't even receive a notification. Having called customer support for this same issue three times before, this time the agent informed me that Instacart cannot guarantee delivery within the selected window....even though Instacart has the ability to change the available windows based on service availability. This unfortunate fact is not found in the terms of service to my knowledge, which is understandable because I'm sure it would likely not be good for business. I am no longer confident in the quality of this service and will no longer be using Instacart. The 10% markup, lack of price adjustment for in-store sales/promotions, and Express for $99 per year is no longer worth it if I can't even get an order on time anymore."

Twice, I have picked a delivery time between 4:00 to 5:00 p.m. and both times my groceries have gotten to my home 30 minutes earlier than that time slot. I, purposefully, chose that time slot so that my groceries would arrive around the same time that I arrive home. Both times the shoppers said that they aren't told what the time slots are. They just  shop and deliver. I'm not sure where the disconnect is but it has caused me to have to pick up my groceries off the ground, in front of my garage, twice. This is not acceptable!

The 2nd delivery person started shopping an hour after I placed the order (when it was due to arrive), shopped for 2 items and then dropped the order completely for the next 1.5 hours. Finally, I get a message from said person 3:30 minutes after delivery time, saying that they cannot find certain item despite telling them exactly where it is in store.

On the heels of us protesting for our tip to go back to a lame 10% from 5% instacart decided to remove our $3 pay bump that we got for good ratings from customers - a great incentive for us to do a good job gone. Not only will shoppers have far less earning opportunity - but customers will feel the ramifications of this. And it was just because the leaders of the company wanted to be petty and punish us for organizing. Like children. Instacart was an okay company to work for in the beginning but it continues to get progressively worse - even when we already think it's as low as it can go. The last shifts I worked average at HALF of minimum wage. We're talking one low pay for 3 long distance deliveries where tips still impact the pay you accept or are later removed for things out of your control. And when we do multiple orders customers are not informed - meaning they are mad at us when it takes longer or their food is thawed out (and either chew us out or remove our tip). This is while you pay for your own gas, your own insurance, your own health care, your own car maintenance, etc. Sometimes you end up spending your money to work for instacart leaving you in the negative.  The market is so over saturated with shoppers that I am sometimes 25 in line just to get a shift (which means I can't just work when I want to work). I tried pre scheduling what ever shifts I could get on the wait list for - but then you have to immediately decide when it opens up if you can take that shift - and if for some reason you end a shift early (even if there is 25 other people ready to take the orders) you get a penalty which impacts your future work and pay. The bonuses, including the referral bonuses, are skewed to be unattainable. We are also rushed through orders (and that timer doesn't stop when we're on the phone with support for an app issue or in a long check out line, mind you). This means we can't actually take the time to find the perfect produce or make good replacements. Slow times = less future pay. The customers have been well conditioned by the owner to leave horrendous tips, if they tip at all. They regularly abuse instacart to avoid commercial delivery fees for things ranging from 800-1500 lbs (which our cars and insurance are technically unable to do - and yes even on 3 cart orders you are timed!). The owner himself doesn't tip drivers when they deliver to his $6.4M loft. When there are abusive customers (ie: those looking to sexually assault women who show up alone to deliver groceries) they are not removed from the platform - infact instacart's response was to make sure a lot of addresses are hidden on orders to force us to accept the order (is it the nice lady in building 2 or the creepy man who corned us and made lewd comments in building 5? SURPRISE). This company has faced many lawsuits - and will continue to face them. And unfortunately as their pay continues to treat the workers as subhuman the customers will suffer. Most of the shoppers who remain are either burnt out or not quality shoppers to begin with. Also - instacart has actually fought with lobby money against your shoppers needing to obtain a food handlers permit so don't be surprised if your meat is next to your produce. I suggest looking into the articles us shoppers have posted on medium, the screencaps posted on twitter detailing the theft, the actual item pricing versus what is on your receipt, and alternative more ethical delivery options."

My husband is disabled and unable to grocery shop and I work out of town a lot. I have used this service a total of 3 times. The first 2 times were not great, missing items, items substituted with things not even remotely in the same category, but at least I received something. This last time, the weekend of our Canadian Thanksgiving holiday, I put my order in to be delivered between 11 am - 1pm. Two minutes after placing the order I received a text saying that they were running behind and the delivery would be between 1 pm- 3pm. By 7 pm that evening I still had not received my order, nor did I get any updates. I called the companies 800 number to be connected with a call centre in what I believe was India. I explained to the person that I did not receive the groceries that I had paid for and they were hours late. I was advised to cancel the order as they didn't have a person booked to shop/deliver the groceries yet. I asked to have my money refunded into my bank account immediately, and was advised that it takes 3-7 business days for a refund (on something I never received in the first place). So not only am I out the groceries that was to make my Thanksgiving dinner with, I am also out the money to buy new groceries for the holiday. They offered me a $5.00 voucher off my next instacart order, which will go unused as I will never use this joke of a company again. Happy Thanksgiving everyone."

So I cancelled that order and created a new one...just to get my refund and see if they were ""true"" to their word.  As I suspected, they were not.  No refund credit to be found.  I again emailed Instacart customer support (oxymoron) and they again apologized.  By now, this is my third or fourth email on this already, and I'm not getting the nearly $50 they owe me.

I called Sprouts to complain about the amount they charged for fennel (smallest piece I had ever seen). The manager told me to call Instacart, and Instacart would refund the fennel charge. That happened. But.... unlike my first Instacart experience, I found the shopper’s receipt in my bag. I asked the Instacart customer service rep questions about how they price items. The outcome of our conversation reveals what I think is a dishonest business practice. At least two produce items on my Instacart receipt were listed at a higher weight than the weights on the Sprouts’ receipt. It is not a lot of money, but are they doing this with orders on a regular basis? Who is going to bother weighing their produce to double-check? The rep informed me that I should not have received the Sprouts’ receipt — it would be marked as a missing receipt from the shopper. What a convenient way to keep the consumer unaware of their business practices! I thanked the rep for being polite, but said I think this practice is dishonest and will not use their services again. (Instacart charged a service fee and delivery fee on top of the Sprouts’ receipt. I thought these were how they make money. Plus, I paid a tip to the shopper, who I figure has nothing to do with Instacart’s pricing.)"

But if you’re able to hang in there, you’ll see what an absolute joke this company is. If not, just know I will never use instacart again or recommend it to anyone.I had been dealing with issues with instacart for almost two weeks. My father used my account for a purchase, then decided later on to create his own account. After his first order, instacart flagged his purchase, canceled it, and deactivated his account. We called to confirm that it wasn’t fraud and ask why this happened. Instacart’s reasoning changed every time I spoke to them. At first they said it was because his first order was too large and they thought it was fraud. We tried to confirm that it was us, but they would not allow us to reactivate his account over the phone. Instead they asked him to send a copy of his drivers license and credit card over email, which is absolutely ridiculous. I can confirm my identity through companies like Bank of America over the phone, so why I can’t confirm over the phone for a simple grocery delivery?Instacart also deleted my father’s credit card from my own separate account since the card was “flagged”, which wouldn’t have been an issue if they would have allowed me to add a new payment method, but they didn’t. Every time I tried to enter a credit card, I received an error code. I called them again and they said it was just an issue with their system and to try again in 15-30 min. When I called again, they said I was probably using the wrong web browser. When I confirmed that I had tried several web browsers, different credit cards, and THEIR OWN APP, they finally said they would escalate the issue into a “case” and that someone would contact me in 24-48 hours. 48 hours later, no one had contacted me. I call again, explain the issues with both my father’s account being deactivated, my account not allowing me to add a payment info, and no one following up with me for 48 hours. The customer service agent told me someone at instacart closed our case without speaking to us which is why no one contacted us. She also said we DID NOT have to send our drivers license and credit card over email, and guaranteed that she herself would get back to me in 24 hours. She never did. I call back two days later and request to speak to a manager because now the new customer service agent claims they have no information on the issues that I’ve been calling about for days. The customer service agent tried multiple times to get me to end the call and agree to another callback but I refused, because no one had ever called me back before and I did not trust that they would follow through. I sat on hold for an hour when a manager finally got on the line. He said that sometimes these issues take at least a week to be fixed, even though they had originally said 24-48 hours. He said the problems in both accounts will be dealt with by the following week.A week later, I receive an email that MY account is now deactivated (dad’s is still deactivated too, no change there). Once again I call customer service and they claim they don’t have any information for me at this time, so I ask again to speak to a manager. When the manager gets on the line, I have to reexplain what happened and that now my account is deactivated, as well as my father’s. He first says that this is because the bank hasn’t verified our info yet and that it’s not their fault. When I question him more about it, he then says it’s because we haven’t emailed our drivers licenses and credit cards and that they can’t confirm our identities without them. Again, I tell him we do not want to send sensitive information like that over email and that an instacart employee told us we did not have to do so. He claims that employee is greatly mistaken and that our accounts won’t be reactivated until this happens. I ask why my account was even deactivated in the first place and the manger claims it’s because it is related to my father’s account. Please note my account and my father’s account are completely separate (different acct number, different address, different names). The only similarity between the accounts was the credit card my father used when he used my account to try out instacart (He’s 60 and not tech savvy). At this point I am beyond frustrated with instacart’s stories constantly changing and them not being able to provide any accurate information. I told the manager there is no reason that my account should be deactivated just because it had the same credit card stored, and that it does not say anywhere on their website that using the same credit card for more than one account is not allowed or recommended. Plus I could not change what credit card was saved anyway since instacart would not allow me to add a different payment method. The manager refused to listen or address my previous issues with their customer service team. He just kept stating that our accounts would not be activated until we submitted our DL and CC info over email and that we were the ones causing instacart to take so long in resolving the problem. He said he didn’t get why it was so difficult for me to understand what he was requesting and that it was just plain “common sense”. I told him he was being very rude and unprofessional. He laughed, denied being rude, and just kept repeating that it was just common sense. I asked to speak to whoever was above him and he said he was as high as you can go. At that moment I told him to delete both my account info and my father’s, and that we would no longer be instacart customers or recommend instacart to anyone. In his own words, leaving instacart was just “common sense”. Beware of this company. Use at your own risk."

They will use store loyalty cards to get a lower price, and then pocket the savings instead of passing them along to the customer (the person paying for those groceries)! They will offer several delivery timeframes, and then not meet them, regardless of what day you choose or time of day. I’ve tried them all, and every time they have to email me to say they won’t make the chosen delivery time. They have terrible customer service, generic responses that don’t answer your concerns, and refuse to refund you for most errors. Many of the shoppers don’t know how to pick out fresh food because they’ve never shopped for their own groceries. The fruit, vegetables, and meat selections are mediocre. They don’t care to look at the expiration dates, so I’ve received several items that were expired or expiring within a day. I’ve received smashed bread, bruised fruit, busted biscuits, and rotten strawberries. My last order had refrigerated fermented food, and it was hot by the time I received the food, so it was bad. It felt like the groceries were sitting in the car for an hour, which is also the reason the can of biscuits exploded. They also use a tipping method, which is completely ludicrous. It’s awkward at best, and you’re having us tip people who are facing things that are out of their control, like: store is out of items, Instacart doesn’t have enough shoppers, traffic, and so on. Why would you have tips for this? USPS, FedEx, and UPS do a better job and they don’t have tips. Instacart is a good concept, but bad execution on the business side. Never again."

They always charge your bank more than your bill saying In case you want to place another item after you finish shopping I never had to do that and this makes it very confusing this should not be done.

This treatment is very hurtful. This company let me down today in the biggest way. I am in an area that is preparing for a horrible storm. I woke this morning early and put an order at 9:30 AM EST. Publix reached out to me around 11:30-AM to let me they ran out of water and flashlights. I called your customer service to have them cancel it. I placed another order right after, it gave me EST for delivery for 1-2 hours. At 12:40 I received an email saying my order will not be here until 3:45-4:45PM.

She said if I can't wait i can got to the store myself, i explained to her AGAIN I can't because I'm disabled and pretty much home-bound.

Let me start by saying I had stopped using the service due to horrible shoppers (in the beginning) however, I decided to give them another try because let’s face it—it IS convenient. For awhile it seemed Instacart may have possibly devoted more time in the TRAINING their people how to shop as I had suggested many times while speaking with their CSR. Anyway. Fast forward to today. My delivery directions are: Please leave the groceries in front of the garage door. I have 4 huge dogs so it’s easier that way. Today I opened the garage door as soon as I received the text that my delivery person was en route. I sat in there waiting and waiting and waiting until I received the standard text to rate the experience. I promptly called Customer Service to get the girl to go back to the wrong address while she was in the neighborhood and pick up my stuff that was sitting in a typical summer downpour. Well that didn’t go over well. At all. In fact the CSR told me that I was being unprofessional and she would have to terminate the call as I was getting highly frustrated enduring the scripted niceties...while trying to get her off the call to go catch the driver .  In the end, they reordered the entire order instead and I had to wait for another delivery. The dumbest system ever. With business practices like this I don’t expect they can keep taking losses for too much longer. So dumb. So, so dumb.One more thing. How dare the CSR threaten to terminate my call because I was upset!!! How is that customer Service.Looks like I’ll be using shipt or Amazon’s delivery service. (Excuse any typos)"

At 11:15 checked the tracker to watch the already late delivery go from 17 minutes arrival time estimated to over a hour till estimated delivery time. 2.  Called the help line to see what the issue was regarding the order going away from the delivery address. The gentleman answering the call was unable to access my account by the phone number he requested. Each time the phone number was communicated he would mix up the numbers in a extreme manner. I had to say each number one at a time and keep correcting him until he got it correct before being able to move onto the next number. My job is dealing with barely speaking and non-English speaking patients to give them proper medical care. Your team member’s lack  of communication skills was unacceptable. 3.  Requested a manger who then put the call on hold. Before doing so stated he would be right back. After more than 12 minutes on hold the call was terminated. 4. Once I informed the third person I attempted to clear up the issue with I would be calling the local police department the delivery arrived five minutes later. 5.  We were told the reason for the turn around was due to GPS issues. The driver and no representative from Instacart communicated the GPS issue in any form. No call, text, or email. We watched as the estimated delivery time increased for 17 minutes to over a hour away. I would like to terminate the agreement due to your company not fulfilling their part of the contract with this incident and other incidents.

I received a call telling me Kroger's registers were down, and my entire order was canceled. The concession was that I would get my money back. First of all, why do they need registers when I've already paid online? Simple math could be used to figure out how much to credit me for items out of stock. I was told the shopper who had my order finished could not wait because other deliveries had to be made. Apparently those deliveries were more important than mine, although mine was obviously first in line. To say that I would receive my money back  - which I still haven't  - is ludicrous! Of course I'm not paying for an order I never received. This was my first and last time trying to use Instacart, and I highly recommend you don't even bother trying it!"

Shopping there was not available for a couple of days while they made the move (I found this out myself after spending hours doing research).   your order delivery times reflected the unavailable times but gave no reason why and your reps had no clue. should have a flag somewhere on your service to notify customers and reps there are special circumstances, so they sound professional and knowledgeable.

The average delivery charge is $5.99.This was the first red flag, but my negative experience began when I placed an order before 4pm, for delivery b/w 5-6pm. Plenty of time when they advertise delivery w/in as little as an hour, right? I received an email confirming my order, and then a second email about 40min later to let me know my order was ""running late"", and would not be delivered until 6:45-7:15pm.Then 7:15pm rolled around, no notification, no follow up email. So I check the status of my order, only to find it hasn't even been started yet! I called the support line, which amounted to 5-10 minutes of being on hold, only to be told that they had no drivers available and would not be able to complete my order until the next day. In addition, I was offered a $10 credit and a ""free month"" of Express Membership. Acceptable, considering I now - at 8pm - had make time to go to the grocery store to get the items I needed?? Hardly.Obviously, I cancelled the order, and sent a follow up email to cancel my Express Membership as well; not expecting a full refund, but a refund based on a prorated amount (ie: $99/12 multiplied by the number of months remaining before the yearly renewal date). Reasonable, right? No, no, no... Their response to this was that because I'd ""used"" the Membership, they could offer no refund and that it would stay active for the term... Which again, I have NO intention of using.So they basically claim that I have used $99 worth of services in the FOUR months that I've been using their platform; again, on average once a month...

We waited until the end of business on 4/26 and still no money. Yet another hour + on the phone where this time the story was that it would take 10 days to get our money back and still no one could tell me why the order was cancelled. Here we are today 5/1 and still no money. Were we a family who did not have the financial means to go to the store on 4/20 and drop another $300 on groceries this would have created an incredible hardship as they would not be able to buy food for the week.

I placed an order on 4/2/19, a Tuesday morning and got my items delivered in the afternoon. Instacart automatically authorizes a payment of 10-15% more than the amount to cover any adjustments or ad ones that might occur during shopping. My total came to $144.94 and was adjusted in my bank account from $170 shortly after receiving my groceries to reflect the final charge. However, that was not the final charge, because they ran my card again for another $144.94 that evening. I have been on the phone with my bank to try and stop this payment, I called Instacart to ask what happened, and I wrote about 6 different emails with documentation of the double charges only to be ignored and dismissed.

They aren't transparent about how much they charge the customer compared the grocery store prices. The last time I used them, I didn't receive several items I ordered and was given three wrong items. I emailed them to get clarity about the charges and they would not tell me. Instead They offered to refund the items I didn't get and they directed me to the page buried on their website that says the prices on their website might be higher than in the store. The mark up is significant. I haven't gone to the store to compare prices and get an exact number but I'm guessing I paid about 20%-30% more for groceries the last time I used the service and that's before delivery cost, service fees, and tip. It's their prerogative if they want to mark up groceries but I don't think the price is worth the service. I won't be using Instacart again. It's not worth the cost of higher groceries and the frequency of mistakes in the orders."

I receive one e-mail I reply and it's a different person replying. First order was late so I complained they changed it back to the right scheduled time. Second They purchased 4 cheese products I only ordered two one and the second was free BOGO item. Third they charged me a delivery fee. I sighed up for the free 14 day trial. The only reason I even tried this service. On the original order page it even showed the delivery was free so I hit order. At that time total was $76.00 and some change. I understand that that total will change due to produce wight. I was charged a delivery fee and $9.57  for cheese that should have been only $4.79. They said they would refund me $2.39 for cheese mistake.  Nothing for delivery fee. I called then to speak to someone I explained why would I pay $3.99 for deliver fee when they have a free trial and that was the only reason I tried them to start with. He said he would refund $5.00. Then I looked on receipt and the only $5.00 off was from a coupon I used when ordering. Not from Instacart. Last I looked I was  billed I think $89.00 and change with no refund from them on my card statement. This was first and last order needless to say. Would have been an easy fix. Just say I'm sorry here is back a refund for the delivery fee and cheese mistake and we would continue a business relationship instead now I will tell everyone I know and do not know to never do business with this group.  You know how that works and they tell a friend and so on and so on.  Will it put you out of business of course not but I can tell you  it certainty doesn't help.

A close friend who lives in South Carolina recently lost her father very suddenly. As we live in Colorado we were questioning how can we show our love and sympathy and decided in the days following the funeral we would send a complete meal via Instacart to the family.  We placed the order 7 days in advance, to feed a family of 4 including two children under the age of 5 as well as their recently widowed mother.   On the day of expected delivery we received notification that the delivery was running approximately 30 minutes late and rather than a 3:30 PM delivery it would be closer to 4:00 PM - ok no worries.   At approximately 6:00 PM we received notification that the delivery had still not arrived.  The family that we had attempted to take stress off of was now sitting at 6:00 PM with two young children and no meal.   Not only did we now add to their stress, we were naturally embarrassed. We contacted Customer Service with Instacart and explained the situation.   The service staff member explained that unfortunately they simply did not have a driver in that area and they would be unable to complete the order.  When we asked why would they not have at least notified us if they didn’t have a driver so we could make other plans ... the answer was “some times life happens”.   Yes, life does happen ... so does death and because of that we look to companies and services to help make life easier in times of need.  A company who’s slogan is “to solve incredibly hard problems to create an experience for our customers that is absolutely magical”.  At this point in the conversation we asked to speak to a manager... we were connected and the gentlemen apologized for the error.  He explained that we were speaking to their National Office and unfortunately they had no control over their regional operations.   Ok ... things were not improving.  They explained they would be happy to cancel the order and not charge us .... really the order that was already 3 hours late that we placed a full week in advance and no one contacted us to tell us there was an issue until after the schedule delivery time???  I would hope I am not being charged.   After looking into the situation we were contacted by management who explained they would be delivering the order the following day if we still wanted to purchase the items.  Additionally, due to the confusion they were happy to extend us a $10 credit.   I’ve been personally in customer service my entire life and unfortunately this situation went from bad to worse.  While simply looking for an apology and and a solution this was never offered but yet only met with excuses and defense.    While we believe the concept of Instacart is solid, it is our opinion there appears to be significant flaws in their independent contractor model and obviously their service team.  The short falls of Instacart and their staff training not only caused us as the customer extreme embarrassment but also caused an already grieving family additional stress.    A $10 credit is a little more of an insult than a solution."

I've been spending approximately $1200 per month with Instacart. I use services like Instacart so I don't have to deal with the uneducated, brain-dead slow incompetent people who work at grocery stores nowadays. Service across the board has become unbearable over the year. It's sad when one finds out there's no escape from such horrible service! I ordered from Ralph's via Instacart. I edited my order and chose ""Do Not Replace"" for 14 of the 15 items. The moment the shopper began putting together the order, I began getting bombarded with numerous texts regarding the items she replaced. I texted the shopper and told her not to replace the items. I further asked her why she was replacing items when the order specifically states not to replace them. She stated the order did not say that. We ordered Cheese Whiz...I know gross for the celery and crackers. Supposedly Ralph's did not have it (we know they did), so the shopper decided to replace it with Tostitos Cheese Dip. What a brain-dead person! Considering the bad and ignorant behavior of that laborer, we drove to the Ralph's store where she compiled the order and sure enough we found the Cheese Whiz she claimed did not exist. On every single order I place via Instacart, there is a specific instruction on it (saved for all orders) stating ""Intercom Code 051"". The illiterate laborer did not bother getting out of her car and instead told Instacart she could not reach me. I received a text from Instacart stating she was waiting in the front because she could not reach me. I knew this was b.s. This is the standard behavior of lazy, sub-par laborers today. I went to the entrance area and the first thing I did was type 051 on the intercom system and sure enough my cell rang; so in other words, it worked. The entire time, the sub-par laborer was sitting in her car. I signaled her; pretty much letting her know I'm not moving another foot. She was the most ghetto, brain-dead, lazy laborer I've dealt with. I will never use Instacart again. There's no way I'm willing to pay for horrible, unreliable service and there's no way in hell I will support stupidity by using a service that hires such uneducated, ignorant people!Update: I was so angry following this review, I decided to contact Instacart via phone. I was surprised their customer service line was open on Sunday. I wasn't expecting that. I spoke to a rep and explained the situation. I could tell that when she reviewed my account, she knew I was serious seeing that I spend a minimum of $1200/month via Instacart and never complain. The customer service rep was nice and very understanding. Thank God their system saves all texts between the shopper and consumer. She was reviewing the texts and could not believe the ignorant things the shopper was stating to me in the texts. The customer service lady realized how serious of an issue this was and transferred me to their ""upper management tier"". I spoke with another lady in the ""upper tier"". I explained the situation. She was very nice and understanding. What concerned me was the lady telling me she's going to take care of the issue and have management have a talk with the employee. That employee should be fired, not warned! I strongly voiced my opinion to the rep stating that it's unacceptable to allow such behavior to occur. Customer service is an innate common sense based skill. One either has the skill, or they don't!  There's no teaching it! It's obvious that delivery person does not have the skill! The uneducated delivery person is a toxic liability to Instacart. Why in the heck would Instacart hold onto a toxic liability and risk losing an asset (customer)? I voiced such to the rep and further stated that there are many qualified people available to do the job."

At 8:20 I received a call stating the driver's car broke down and would not be able to get my order delivered tonight. My issue is not with the driver.   I am sympathetic to a hard working person who is experiencing problems,  my issue is with Instacart.  They should have back up solutions when issues arise.  I was depending on that delivery to be here tonight.  I was willing to compromise if they could get it delivered by 8AM but they said they could not call a delivery person when they're not on shift. They were only willing to promise delivery between 9-10, which didn't work for me as the rest of the family was coming for breakfast in the morning.

This company is dishonest and hideous. They increase the price of each item by 15% or more of its original retail price. They hide this part by not allowing the driver to share the retailer's original receipts with customers. I have contacted their customer service many times in regards of this issue but got the same answer every time that ""the original receipt does not reflect the amount you have been charged"". What a crap! The original receipt does of cause not reflect the actual charge, the difference is the money this company steals from its customers.  This hidden charge does not include additional service fee and tips to the driver and shopper. So you do the maths, how much you'd pay for an order. I'd suggest using Prime Now or Walmart delivery service instead of this crap."

The store which usually sells Bachman brand Air-Popped Butter Popcorn has stopped carrying it for some reason so I searched for alternate ways to get it.  Instacart's website had a photo of the Bachman popcorn so I ordered 10 bags with clear instructions to NOT SUBSTITUTE ANYTHING ELSE.  When the shopper arrived to deliver my 10 bags of Bachman popcorn, he handed me 2 shopping bags, turned, and almost RAN away!  Before he got 2 feet away I looked inside the bags and immediately saw they did NOT CONTAIN WHAT I ORDERED so I called him back saying, ""Hey, where are you going? I didn't order these!""  He kept going.  I said, ""Wait!  Take these back with you - I didn't order these and I don't want them!""  He stopped, turned, and said, ""Take it up with Instacart!""  I said, ""Take these back with you!  I specifically made the notation on my order to NOT SUBSTITUTE ANYTHING!""  He said, ""I don't take things back - I only deliver things.  If you have any problem, tell Instacart, not me.""  So I contacted Instacart and they asked me to send them a photo of what I received.  I took the photo of the stuff, sent it to them, AND HAVEN'T HEARD BACK FROM ANYONE IN OVER A WEEK.  I had to initiate a ""Claim"" with my Credit Card Company and have been still waiting for them to resolve the issue.  I ordered 10 bags of popcorn and got 10 bags of corn chips of a totally unknown name brand.  My Instacart experience was a complete rip off and a nightmare!  Of course, if your shopper found exactly what you ordered and you got it, you should have no complaints but as soon as you order something that they can NOT find, they don't care that you indicated NO SUBSTITUTIONS - if they honored that, they wouldn't have been able to make the sale.  They'd rather ignore their own ""No Substitutions"" box and send anything before admitting they could not fulfill your order.  Not even my credit card company has been able to get through to them!  They have a way of ignoring all contact attempts that may result in a refund.  I can't even find a phone number for them as they ignore all email requests for attention and refund.  These 10 bags of corn chips are sitting on my floor for 2 weeks now, waiting for someone to come pick them up.  Do yourself a favor and find a more reputable shopping service."

I was referred by a friend with a $20 off AND free delivery coupon code. The coupon was applied but wasn’t reflecting in the bill, so I called Instacart support. The lady told me to place the order to see if it would show up. Then when it didn’t show up, she checked with her supervisor and said there’s a new rule she was unaware of - I have to spend $35 or more for the coupon to work. It would have been nice to know that either on the coupon itself or from the Instacart employee who should know her business. She told me to cancel the order and place another one and wait a couple days for the money to be pulled from my bank, maybe it just takes processing time. I did another order for $35 and waited but nothing was applied and the order ended up over $50 after delivery and taxes. I called again and was told that I would be refunded the $20 but not the delivery because free delivery only counts on the first order. I explained that the only reason my first order was cancelled was because I was TOLD to cancel it by Instacart themselves. The man said his supervisor would have to investigate it and that I should receive an email about what’s going on. I had planned on sending a picture I took of the initial coupon to prove it had FREE DELIVERY. I received no email or call after 2 days so I called again. A lady told me there was something on my account and she was surprised I hadn’t been contacted yet. She said she was sure I’d get a response soon. A week and a half later I finally call again and FINALLY they say I can get refunded the delivery fee, only to be told then that it had been so long since the order that they are unable to refund me the delivery fee. It’s INSTACART’s fault that it took so long. They offered me a credit on my account but why would I ever place another order with this company? I left a review on my order and was reached out to be an Instacart employee, and I explained to him the situation. He told me that free delivery only applies to the first order which I already knew. The problem was my first order didn't get any of the coupon applied which is the company's fault. It's like he didn't even read what I said. He passed me off to yet ANOTHER Instacart employee who asked me to detail what happened. I again had to explain the entire situation, and she told me she had applied a free delivery credit on my account but that I'd have to spend $35 for it to work. I told her I didn't want a credit as I had stated before, especially since I've had such a bad experience. I said I would be reporting this to the BBB. After an entire week yet ANOTHER Instacart employee reached out just to say that I was already refunded the $20 for the $20 off portion of the coupon. I already knew that! I'm trying to get the money back for the delivery that was supposed to be FREE. They also tried calling me, but since it was a number I didn't know I of course didn't answer. Instead of leaving a voicemail, they called 4 times and left no messages and mentioned nothing about it via email. They called 4 times back-to-back and I had to keep ignoring the calls because I was at work. Very unprofessional."

Not only do you pay for the meal itself but they add extra charges for “just incase we dont have it and need to substitute” I called every sprouts store in the area and they all said they do not have access to instacart and that they are not directly connected. I called insta cart and they give you the runaround how sorry they are. And apparently i wasnt the only one calling about this there were a few other people complaining about the same situation. So if youre going to order a holiday meal from sprouts or vons/safeway or any other place that hires this company dont order online call instead because you will be greatly disappointed paying for something and not receiving it and not even knowing it until the day of the event.

You can, however, purchase four insulated bags direct from instacart. strange thing is Instacart will allow you to use whatever you have until you receive their insulated bags?  so you can use whatever bags you have for ten days, but you cannot deliver with whatever bags you have to begin with?Problems with the application approval process The worst part for me was the ongoing back and forth of waiting for my application to be approved, they sent an Instacart Card, and Instacart Visa charge card, I was ready to begin..I was able to select hours..Everything was fine, until it wasn't and no real explanation for the delay.

However it's become dismal and a recent series of mishaps has me so infuriated I've vowed never to use it again and will stick with Shipt. Aside from a growing number of specific item issues where something isn't in stock and strange substitutions, small forgotten items, then not being notified of substitutions until the shopper closed the order, then about 2 weeks ago, There was $150 worth of groceries left at the wrong door, then on the very next order, it took 3 tries and multiple angry emails with support and 2 phone calls to get a bag of dog food I ordered that was left out of my delivery. They were insisting on giving me a credit on my next order, but I told them there would be no next order and I wanted what I paid for at no extra cost to me. Here's the deal- I paid a %5 service charge on that $15 bag of food. The credit would have only been for the item plus tax (per support). I was told the service charge was what they use to ""provide me with the best possible service and it was nonrefundable"". Really? So if I order it again, I would pay that charge a second time on the subtotal before credits are applied, even though I only received it once. I opted for redelivery. Then the following day after making myself available for that delivery, someone came with an order- it wasn't mine. It was anything but one bag of food I was supposed to get. She was on the phone rooting through her car for awhile, then just left and the redelivery was cancelled without notice. I had to call, again, and demand, again, that they redeliver my food at no charge. I did not want a credit on a future order. So I pay more for them to mess up an order. Furthermore, because the food is only $15, I can't order it by itself without a $10 service charge, so I'd be forced to order another $20 in items in order to avoid that. So in short, mistakes are incentivized by tethering customers to make future orders and pay further service fees and tips. All to get what you paid for today. I had to speak to about 6-8 different support team members to demand they bring the food, by itself, with no cost to me. And this after they inflated their fees and yearly membership by %50 and 5% on all orders. To add a little salt in that wound, the service personnel I've dealt with were rude, accusatory, fail to understand math, give nothing more than a script without hearing your problem, make correction of those problems difficult, and if you go online they blame customers for being disgruntled and accuse clientele of complaining only to get free stuff. What I really want is a pro-rated refund of my annual membership fee. Not asking for anything I didn't pay for, I just want out. Service is dismal from what it was when allegedly they raised fees to improve the quality. Not so, Instacart."

The Insta Cart people are also not the best at customer service, they over charge your card for example if your order comes to $65,42 they charge your card $80.00 I speak from experience if the driver is hungry enough he/she cancels the order and either returns some of the items after being driven all over  in some strange car clean/unclean unkown been on the phone with insta cart for over a 1/2 hour waiting for a manager told that a cheryl girl was the shopper and then transfered the gtoceries to a willie guy who the said he did not get a an answer to the call to deliver to my GRADUATE STUDENT SON but never got off their asses and rang the doorbell to the Large bldg, with many students.

They upcharge items bought through their service but do not divulge by how much. For a whole chicken that cost 11.52 in store. The upcharge was 14.99 a pound and it came to $62 in my instacart.2. They withhold store receipts so you can't see how much they are upcharging you. 3. The $62 chicken increased my order amount. Even though I had the shopper removed it from my cart I was still charged a higher service fee that included the amount with the chicken. The fees are supposed to enforce scaled. They refused to correct the fee and refund me.4. After all this crap. I asked to have my yearly subscription fee refunded. I had only used it once. The yearly fee covers only the $5 delivery fee. So they are refusing to refund me the $149 because I used the service once for $5.They are stealing money from their customers. This service is not okay. Stay away!

I added about 25 items items to my cart with a base delivery fee of $7.99 (not including the service fee). I felt okay paying the delivery fee and service fee since it was such a big order and had a lot going on that day with little time to go pick it up myself. I placed the order and shortly after got notified that my shopper was working on my order. Then all these notification start popping up that certain items are unavailable. So i go in my app and its allowing me to choose replacement items. I approved all the changes and then an hour later i get notified that my order is done and on its way. Well, when it was delivered, I only received 12 of the 25 items i ordered. I called Instacart wondering why I didnt receive the replacement items?? CS said that as ""a shopper it can be stressful to try and get your order done fast so they probably dont look at your change requests. If you really want them to replace an item, you should message them and tell them."" Where in their app does it say ""Even though we have this item replacement feature, if you REALLY want a replacement item, you will have to message your shopper""??? Anyway, long story short, i will not be using instacart again - it was so unreliable and I had to end up taking a trip to the grocery store anyway to get the remaining items which - ehem - were not out of stock."

Instacart Community Support""Even the worst stores give 2-4 weeks return policy, but considering this and high markup of the items, which we calculated at about 40% above Costco in store prices, plus the $5.99 ""delivery fee"" and $8 ""service fee"" and separate ""gratuity"", this Instacart is the worst business operation we have dealt with. We hope all others will understand there are no returns on defective items with Instacart. The picture of one of the avocados was after 11 days after delivery, and will not ripen normal.On the initial day of delivery, we failed to receive some ordered items, and instead of refunding us the same day we complained about missing items, Instacart insisted we only be given a future credit. We had to make an additional request with supporting emphasize why we want a refund to our original CC payment and not a future ""Instacart credit"". Stay away from Instacart, unless you like being ripped off, mistreated, cheated, and wasting more time writing online reviews than it takes to buy from somewhere else or drive to the store yourself.Instacart founder is Apoorva Mehta. Below is a copy and paste of a few of his Instacart indictments in only the last 2 years, which is all being bankrolled by too many ""too big to fail"" financial bail out firms to count.In March 2017, Instacart agreed to pay a $4.6 million class action settlement stemming from the misclassification of its shopper employees as independent contractors. The suit alleged 18 violations, including improper tip pooling and failure to reimburse workers for business expenses.[27] Instacart has also faced intense criticism from its workers and tech media for removing the option of its customers to tip their shopper in November 2016. Backlash against the policy forced the company to reinstate the tipping option only weeks later.[28] In November 2017, a large number of Instacart workers participated in a strike against the company, alleging wages as low as $1 an hour. Instacart claimed that the strike had no impact on its operations.[29] In February 2018, Instacart mistakenly withheld tips given from it's customers to shoppers, and blamed a ""bug."" Customers who also waived the service fee were often still charged.[30] In April 2018, Instacart instituted a controversial non-waiveable 5% service fee on all orders.[31]"

Would save me a lot of frustration. Have used Instacart many times before for convenience, despite their ridiculous markups AND service fee. Placed an order tonight as feeling too sick to make a grocery store run on the way home. Order was to be delivered 9-10pm. Not my first choice but only availability. Order was confirmed immediately, but no driver ever claimed the order. At 10:15pm I decide ti cancel the order as I can no longer stay up. After lots of searching on the Instacart app a google search finally yields a phone number for customer service. Rosemary, my customer service rep, proceeds to tell me that the driver cancelled my order and issued a full refund. No Rosemary, that would be me since my delivery window passed without Instacart app seeming to give a flip. After saying her flippant sorry, there is just silence from her end. No ""sorry for the inconvenience"", no ""can I help you get this rescheduled"", nothing but the silence of crap customer service. When I point out that her response is inconsiderate to a paying customer who didn't receive the promised goods AND who had used their service multiple times in the pasr, she tells me irately that there is nothing else that needs to be done. In response to me then informing her that her customer service skills are the reason I will no longer be using Instacart, she hangs up on me. So yep, I will take my money someplace else. If anyone at Instacart ever wonders why they can't compete with Amazon, here's your answer. Good customer service is invaluable, and people will be loyal customers to businesses that treat them well in return."

The markup on each item was outrageous. The shopper needlessly substituted cheaper/lesser products but the price difference was not reflected in my final bill.

We notified them through their order/issue option 5 days ago but have not heard anything from them other than an acknowledgement of receipt. We will never use them again and would not recommend them to anyone! As a senior citizen who suffers from chronic asthma, a grocery delivery service at this time seemed to be a godsend, but this experience has proven to be more hellish than necessary. Our Costco groceries totalled $343.10 but our InstaCart Bill was $452.40 for a difference of over $109.00.

I gave one star even though the delivery driver did his job well because I feel robbed by this company!

The markup on each item was outrageous. The shopper needlessly substituted cheaper/lesser products but the price difference was not reflected in my final bill. Example: We ordered chicken breasts and received chicken thigh meat. The package price was $15.24 but InstaCart price was $37.60, a difference of over $22.00. We notified them through their order/issue option 5 days ago but have not heard anything from them other than an acknowledgement of receipt. We will never use them again and would not recommend them to anyone! As a senior citizen who suffers from chronic asthma, a grocery delivery service at this time seemed to be a godsend, but this experience has proven to be more hellish than necessary. Our Costco groceries totalled $343.10 but our InstaCart Bill was $452.40 for a difference of over $109.00.

I gave one star even though the delivery driver did his job well because I feel robbed by this company!

The markup on each item was outrageous. The shopper needlessly substituted cheaper/lesser products but the price difference was not reflected in my final bill. Example: We ordered chicken breasts and received chicken thigh meat. The package price was $15.24 but InstaCart price was $37.60, a difference of over $22.00. We notified them through their order/issue option 5 days ago but have not heard anything from them other than an acknowledgement of receipt. We will never use them again and would not recommend them to anyone! As a senior citizen who suffers from chronic asthma, a grocery delivery service at this time seemed to be a godsend, but this experience has proven to be more hellish than necessary. Our Costco groceries totalled $343.10 but our InstaCart Bill was $452.40 for a difference of over $109.00.

I gave one star even though the delivery driver did his job well because I feel robbed by this company!

NEVER, EVER again!

The markup on each item was outrageous. The shopper needlessly substituted cheaper/lesser products but the price difference was not reflected in my final bill. Example: We ordered chicken breasts and received chicken thigh meat. The package price was $15.24 but InstaCart price was $37.60, a difference of over $22.00. We notified them through their order/issue option 5 days ago but have not heard anything from them other than an acknowledgement of receipt. We will never use them again and would not recommend them to anyone! As a senior citizen who suffers from chronic asthma, a grocery delivery service at this time seemed to be a godsend, but this experience has proven to be more hellish than necessary. Our Costco groceries totalled $343.10 but our InstaCart Bill was $452.40 for a difference of over $109.00.

I gave one star even though the delivery driver did his job well because I feel robbed by this company!

NEVER, EVER again!
