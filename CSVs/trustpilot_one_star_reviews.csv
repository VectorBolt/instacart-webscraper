I have also done instacart and they constantly deactivated my account saying I was not who I said I was even after providing more than enough proof that I was. There have been problems with my app and Corporate is unprofessional. Do not recommend these hoes

Was waiting for an order today got a notification that my shopper had checked out. My order total was $52. Got another notification that my shopper was unable to deliver my order and they would find someone to deliver ASAP. Got another notification that my order total was $208. Canceled the order and called my bank. Will never use them again

My order has to be delivered yesterday but they said sorry we have to reschedule it for today at 11 but they didn't send it at 11 and they said it's rescheduled again for 2 p.m. so now you can judge how bad they are in the customer service thing.At the end I have to cancel my order and go pick up all the brushes myself I ordered it because with the kids a little hard but I think they have the worst to First customer service I have ever seen in my life

https://ca.trustpilot.com/reviews/5fd7779a755dc10b48223859,Nikki Vedo,1 star: Bad,!!!!!!!!!!Shoppers for instacart…,!!!!!!!!!!Shoppers for instacart beware!!!!!!!!!!!Customers will bait you with big tips and once the order is delivered will take the full tip away. After lugging 6 boxes filled with items downhill and up flights of stairs for a $134 tip the customer removed the tip amount claiming all items were damaged and accused me of stealing a comforter that wasn’t even on the receipt. The customer did not offer photo proof and Instacart has no shopper support. The order was for $161 total for 90 items from Costco. I walked away with $34 for the entire order after the customer removed their tip. Instacart is a scam!!!

Shopper took 2 1/2 hours to pick out three simple items at the store. 30 seconds after he marked it as check out complete and en route, he marked it as delivered but my groceries were nowhere to be found and I live 25 minutes from the store so there’s no way he could’ve made it there in 30 seconds. The proof of delivery photo was just a black square. Guessing he stole my groceries now I’m left with nothing to eat for dinner because the store is now closed. First and last time using instacart."

https://ca.trustpilot.com/reviews/5fd55ee5755dc107e0c1340b,Vanessa Morris,1 star: Bad,Shady shoppers who literally steal from customers,"So far I really haven't had any issues other than an item or 2 missing out of my order. I get it, it happens and the shoppers probably have multiple orders they shop for. However, I placed an order for 8 items at Publix (Florida grocery store) that totaled $54.34. I see 3 different things added to my order that I DEFINITELY DID NOT add. The problem with these is the 3 of them combined cost $141.97. SO NOW my order totaled at $196.31. I took a screen shot of the added items and reached out to Erik (my shopper). I said why were these added I did not add these. His response ""Yes"".... So, my next message was ""I want the receipt for my order when you drop off the groceries""... Next notification I received seconds after that message to him was ""your order has been delivered"". I was literally standing out front in my driveway when that notification came through.I called customer service. BOY are they a joke. They answered, apologized and they said they would issue a full refund for my order and it would be deposited in 5-10 business days. I don't think it is fair I have to wait 5-10 business days for their shopper stealing from a customer and racking up the bill more than twice the amount I originally planned on spending and esp before Christmas. I still have Christmas presents to purchase, which this now sets me back a little. So, moving forward. I told the customer service representative I would like to take more action and calling the cops. The customer service rep kept repeating himself saying Instacart is handling it. So, if anything legal happens they don't give you any information whatsoever if you decide to escalate the situation to local authorities. I asked what their policy was regarding legalities. The customer service rep had no idea. Instacart is a multimillion possible multibillion dollar corporation with no policies regarding legalities. They just keep saying ""Instacart is taking care of it"". This raises concerns, esp if something drastic did ever happen. What if this shopper comes to my house (since he knows my address now) because I reported him and retaliates against me? What then? What happens at that point (god forbid it happens)? Instacart has no company policy in this regard. I now have to keep an eye on my bank account and hope they do in fact refund my money their shopper stole from me. I really do not recommend Instacart. I know it is convenient when you don't have the time to shop but when something like this happens it truly is not worth it. I run 2 successful shops on Etsy, when I issue a refund to a customer the money is deposited within 24-48 hours. I know Instacart can in fact have the money deposited quicker. They just choose not to."

I went to the door immediately and was just in time to see the back of his car disappearing. The groceries were not mine, I didn't order anything. There was no receipt or ID of any kind. The store was identifiable by the bags and they told me the groceries were delivered by Instacart. Mostly frozen foods and other perishables. I took time from my work to scour the neighbors trying to find the rightful recipient with no luck. INSTACART DOES NOT ANSWER THEIR PHONES AT ALL AND THERE WAS NO WAY TO CONTACT THEM ONLINE WITHOUT AN ORDER NUMBER! I had no recourse but to give the food to a needy family. WOULD I USE INSTACART? NEVER!If you order from them and they don't deliver and/or don't give you a proper refund for anything, call your credit card company. They will stand behind you and reverse the charge."
https://ca.trustpilot.com/reviews/5fd4e31e755dc10b48208c42,Tina Coyle,1 star: Bad,Credit on future orders rather than Refunds?!?!?!?,"Instead of a refund for items not received I got a credit towards a future purchase. WHAT THE HECK!?!?!?!?! I would have to pay more in delivery fees, service fees (YES, THEY HAVE MULTIPLE FEE CATEGORIES) and tips than the cost of the items, and would have to go through the same crap experience, to me this amounts to EXTORTION or STEALING. They charged me for items I didn't get, and now won't return the money unless I spend more with them. They take too many orders then blame high volume for poor customer service. I would happily pick a delivery window for a following day rather then get garbage service. Taking my money for a service you are too overbooked to provide is not ethical.If you contact them about multiple issues (in my case expensive items that I was charged for but never received and fresh vegetables waaayyy beyond the questionable stage - they were literally dissolving into disgusting goo) they will take several days to only address the first issue.A while back I tried using them to get my mother some groceries in another city, items were never delivered although they claim they were and we were charged and had to fight over a refund. She has a doorbell camera (so we have proof they didn't arrive) and an easy to identify/find apartment and we get deliveries from restaurants and such without issues all the time. I've tried using the app several times over the last year, thinking that perhaps they just needed time to adjust to the larger volume of Covid orders and I didn't want to give up on them in the middle of a crisis. But nothing is improving, if anything customer service is going downhill. I've been having much better luck with AMAZON FRESH and will use them exclusively for deliveries from now on. Highly recommend them. If you have an Amazon Prime Membership there are no delivery fees as well, WIN WIN!"

The store you may be shopping at could have a sale, but they will charge you full price. Then, if you contact customer support, they will do nothing about the money you lost. Even if you ask the shopper to use the store reward card. They don’t tell you that you don’t get the sale. They just keep your money. If you ask for a supervisor, you will be told one is not available and will call you back, then will never call you. If it available, use the stores shopping and delivery app. Do not use instacart!

When I reported to instacart, with a chart of charged weight and actual weight. I got a reply that intacart is refunding the short-changed/short supplied price difference. Nobody had the courtesy to explain daylight robbery. It is like if you catch a thief, instead of going to jail he agrees to return stolen goods but charges you for his time and effort in conducting the robbery. (like the fee and tip Charged) I checked their service only twice but they charged me C$112.00 yearly fee there is no reunfd option.

Shoppers must be trained better to use the app and be willing to look for the requested items. Many times I have asked for replacements on very generic items (chicken, shredded cheese, wheat bread) and I get refunded for the item instead. I find it very hard to believe that the store is completely out of these items, so the shopper is either lazy, doesn’t know how to use the app, lacks common sense, or all of the above. I am currently 6 months pregnant and am trying to avoid leaving my house during the pandemic as much as possible.

Yes, they charge too much by marking up prices. My experience with drivers has been mostly good. I had one instance when there was items in my order that I didn't order, but I wasn't charged for them. I had another instance where there was items in my order that I didn't order and there were missing items from my order that I was charged for. I used the app to report my missing items, and I was refunded for them. The shopper on that trip had informed me she was shopping 2 orders at once. That should not be allowed, as that is probably how my order got screwed up, and probably the other customer's order as well. I emailed Instacart about not letting a shopper do 2 orders at once but all I got was a canned response ""I am sorry for the inconvenience ..."".On Thursday I tried placing a order for Friday delivery. I got a message that there was no time slots available until Monday! I check another store, it said the same thing, I checked all 34 stores on my app, all said the same thing. Now a logical person would deduce that there is something wrong with their scheduling system. I tried going on their online chat to report this. after 1.5 hours waiting I gave up and left. I sent an email instead. All I got was the canned response ""I am sorry for the inconvenience ..."". Their customer service reps cannot read and comprehend English, and have no idea how to apply logical thinking.I checked the app and the website on Saturday, all 34 stores still say next delivery on Monday. The system in my area has been broken for at least 3 days now. I checked ordering in other zipcodes of my state, scheduling orders are functioning normally. Instacart you deserve to fail."

She set the stuff down and knocked so softly we couldn't hear her. (We saw this later on our camera system.) But we also saw she never did bring in the paper products. What a pain. Now I have to pay another of their ridiculous delivery fees to order the items again! I'll just order through Walmart and go pick it up myself in the pickup area. Not using Instacart again.

I’m in quarantine, so didn’t have the option to go to a grocery store.Goods are significantly higher than in store, with much more limited selection. I specifically designated no substitutions; they substituted two items anyway. The items were more than double the price of those I selected (one was almost 4x the price), and one item I can’t use at all due to allergy. They did not send a receipt so I can’t even refund in store after quarantine. Contacted their customer service, who said they’d issue an account credit. I don’t live here, so that’s completely useless to me.  Followed up again to get a receipt issued, and now they won’t even answer messages. Terrible. Definitely do not recommend."

This most recent time, I ordered a 12-14 pound turkey, which Kroger has on sale for $5.55. This was the primary item I wanted. I added  about 10 other items to my cart. I specified ""no substitutions"". I paid $12.48 in surcharges for delivery. I got 2 text messages saying Kroger was out of stock on a soup and garlic I ordered. And then the order was dropped off (late). My turkey was out of stock.  The shopper substituted a $35, 25 pound turkey for the $5.55 turkey. They substituted dry roasted sunflower seeds for a can of soup. I WAS SO MAD!!! I tried calling Kroger. They said to call Instacart. I called and spent 45 minutes on hold and was eventually told they would credit me the $30 difference between the two turkeys.....but on a future order. I agreed, but then discovered  I will still have to pay a surcharge for picking up an order. The bottom line is, swapping a 25 pound, $35  turkey for one that is $5.55 is BAIT & SWITCH. Kroger still has the $5.55 turkey listed on their website! I know darn well that they are not many families that want a huge turkey for Thanksgiving this year. I believe the sale price turkey is featured on Instacart so they can scam people into (instead) buying the big turkeys that Kroger is having a hard time selling. And how about substitution of dry roasted sunflower seeds for a can of spanish rice soup? Does that make ANY sense at all??"

That they HAD tried to deliver my groceries but I was not at home to answer my door. I work from home so that's a total lie.  I stated that I was at home, and in the past it has never required for me to be at home as it is a no contact delivery. They have always been able to leave it outside my door. Then I was asked to wait, after 40minutes of waiting, he hung up on me. I called back, I got someone I could barely understand told me that again I was MIA, and they needed me at home because I was purchasing alcohol. I was not purchasing alcohol, and I informed her of this. Which by the way she should already know if she's looking at my account. She seemed confused and was extremely rude, and by this time my faith in their customer care is slowly plummeting to hell. She transferred me to her supervisor whom I can only understand a little better, who spoke to me in the most condescending manner , who spoke over me, well actually they both did, that it is Instacart policy for their shopper to hand deliver the customer their groceries. That it is unsafe to leave it outside and in no uncertain terms will they do so. I've ordered from Instacart multiple times in the past, and that were not the case.

I called AGAIN and got a customer service who assured me it was not a charge but a refund.  I asked her to send me a confirmation email to prove that they issued the refund. Sure enough, I was placed on hold and then she hung up on me. Called AGAIN and finally was told yes, my account was never cancelled, refund was never issued and he can do a partial refund for my membership since the previous customer agent messed up and that's just instacart policy.

Until I found out I was charged 16.7% more for the groceries - just the groceries. This is NOT including the 6 additionals: “checkout bag tax or fee”, “delivery fee”, “service fee”, “groceries HST” (on top of the already included HST in the 16.7% mentioned above), “service HST”, and “Tip” (if you’re a millionaire). I always thought their fees were ridiculously high, but now to find out I could’ve saved $18.39 from their overpricing in addition to the $15.74 in fees (no tip) by going to do grocery pickup instead, is unreal. This company is shady and should be telling you how much of a markup you’re paying without knowing.

I even went to the store and got a detailed receipt that showed the store received the correct amount of money for the smaller item-but my credit card was charged incorrectly.  There is no way to get in direct contact with them-the store manager told me of the ""ins and outs"" of how they have to deal with them and he didn't have anything positive to say.  I brought the smaller tub of butter and asked if I could exchange it right there but because of the rules with Instacart, he wouldn't let me.  I had my emailed receipt to prove I had been charged for the larger one, but to no avail.So, the only thing I would suggest is doing a full inventory with the shopper when they deliver-and if there is a mistake, you can try and work with that individual, hoping they will do the right thing.  The $3.00 isn't the issue-it's the fact the company hasn't responded or even acknowledged my issue after submitting 5 complaints."

It’s all on them and they should fix things before they are just a memory of generating a great biz idea they couldn’t execute with integrity. When Instacart first started, I jumped on it as I’m a busy woman and the local grocery stores have long lines and super crowded, so for me, it was worth the extra $$ to save precious time to be at home with the family.  That was just over a year ago.I did encounter a few problems, but the good outweighed the bad as long as I didn’t have to call customer service. Their customer service is the absolute worst ever!!!!  99% of them can speak just a little English, but cannot comprehend complex issues in English which just infuriates me to no end.  When you ask for someone in a leadership role or to be connected to someone in the US, they say NO quite rudely or hang up on you.  But again, I put this aside because of the convenience and 4 out of 5 orders being right was worth it...Until my subscription ended and I renewed for another year.They pushed me to renew but they didn’t disclose that on top of the $99 membership fee AND their price gouging (50 cents to $2 more per item) they added an additional varying fee to each delivery.  The whole idea of getting the membership was to avoid fees.  When I contacted them, some rude lady said I couldn’t cancel and get my $99 back and that the additional fees were to“Support the Instacart platform”So, a 17 BILLION dollar company needs to squeeze more fees from us to support their platform while cheating their shoppers/drivers because most customers take that fee from the tip.  Not only that, but 5 out of 5 of my latest orders were filled wrong or sent to shopper at the store’s other location 20 miles away that don’t carry the items on the website and therefore cancelled.  The website is always  wrong now. So what about that fee to support the platform??  Instacart is seriously going down the tubes...sewage tubes. Many stores are now kicking Instacart out and developing their own delivery service eliminating Instacart, saving money, giving us Customers better prices and hiring the same local GOOD shoppers/drivers but passing on the shady ones who dump your groceries at someone else’s unit, leave them next to the trash or pretend they cant find your apartment so you have to come down and get the groceries yourself....yes this has happened many, many times.  I’m DONE with Instacart.So people beware!  Call your grocery stores corporate offices and tell them how much Instacart SUCKS and beg them to develop their own shoppers/drivers.  Sprouts and a couple other stores have already dumped Instacart and I hope many more will follow suit and hire their own drivers."

So I'm dependent on Instacart for deliveries from grocery stores and WalMart.  These shoppers are the worse.  I give detailed instructions of what I want and if the store doesn't have it then refund my money.  When I say DON'T REPLACE, I mean don't replace it.  I've had several of these shoppers literally text me back that their tip amount is going down because store is not stocked.  Not my problem!!! Chat with the store manager.  I still have to keep an eye on them because they will do it anyway.  When a shopper starts my order.  I text them and say ""if you shop for ME and not ""the store""  your tip will go up.  They don't get this either!!!  I start the tip amount @ 5% so they know they are getting something.  I'm guessing they seem to want to do a BAD job and get 5% vs. doing a good job and getting 10% to 15%.  Makes no sense to me.I just moved into a gated complex.  Oh my God thee people can't even find the Office where the keypad is for getting in.  Last night (11.11.2020) the woman Olga calls me from her car to ask where my apartment is.  She didn't even bother to try to find the Office.  I told her to stay where she was and I would find her.  NO!! she starts driving around the complex.  It took me 15 minutes of walking from one end of my complex to the other plus being on the phone with a Instacart Rep who is trying to convey instructions from me to Olga.  She's tells him she's in a corner.  Well the building has 4 corners.The woman who went to WalMart for me Vivianna, is so worried about her tip rather than doing a good job, she substituted food without changing it on the order so I didn't know she did that.  I now have cat food that my cats won't eat and I have to throw it out.  I asked for a 6oz can of tuna, well I paid for a 6oz can of tuna and got a 3oz.  And when she leaves she throws in the comment ""God Bless""  yeah well screw me!!!Then there was the lady who went to Sprouts.  Not only did I get my order (not to my specifications) I got someone else's order.  I got a 3lb bag of frozen kale & berries, 2 1lb bags of frozen blueberries, 2 cans of pumpkin and 10 peanut power bars.  I threw it all out.  She at least found the Office but calls me and asks how to get in.  Again instructions are very, very clear on what to do.To say something nice about Instacart.

Instead, about an hour later I started getting HUNDREDS of dollars or charged to mine and my husband’s two separate credit cards. They went on previous transactions and added a “service fee” of $100 dollars to multiple different transactions. I have been in contact with customer care via both email and phone and I’ve spent countless hours trying to resolve this to no avail. I’m now out approximately $500 for absolutely nothing thanks to Instacart. In fact, I requested a refund for my express membership due to this horrible experience, and they just canceled me. I still have no received ANY resolution regarding the hundreds of dollars that this company stole from me. Has this happened to anyone else??"

Also, they will keep writing you that an item is getting low and wish to substitute them with their branded items! Sickening! Shoppers are very unprofessional.

This caused me to have to wait on the phone for 30 minutes with Instacart 1800 number being aggravated trying to track him down, because most likely he forgot the cases in his trunk. He didn’t pick up the phone call from the Instacart rep who tried to call him to ask him to come back. So now I have to wait 3 more hours for a redelivery and pray to God Giant still has the items in stock because that will be next they don’t have themIn stock as usual. (Thats another thing if you order anything heavy, the store will always be “out of stock” of it.  Very stressful situation for me today and I didn’t need it right now I’m in no shape to be stressed right now which is what this service is supposed to be for to help people in need. This is the exact reason why I don’t tip ahead of time until my order is delivered because 9/10 there’s always something MAJORLY wrong with the order and it will always be the one thing I really needed. None of them look at the instructions under the products. Ground beef you’ll order 2lbs fresh ground beef they will deliver that rolled up frozen thing that’s about the size of your palm that’s another thing that gets me. Just horrible horrible service.

So far, it's been an okay experience. Why I stuck to using it for this long is because I work 2 jobs. You do get stuck with some unprofessional shoppers who do a sloppy job at handling your groceries and not being careful with the fragile items (ex: eggs and bread). I wish there was a quick option where you can avoid a shopper you don't want for future orders. The only way you can do that is to call instacart's customer service to have them block that shopper directly. I dislike the tip system, how it automatically gives the shopper 5% of the total amount of your final purchase. Especially since you don't know if that shopper will handle your groceries with care. I believe they should have that option AFTER they are done delivering the groceries. Now, why I have decided to stop using instacart for good: The last purchase I made, the shopper had already paid for the groceries. But I noticed that at the very bottom of the grocery list, there was an item added to my card that said ""error"". It showed an amount of x2 for $75. So I was also being charged for this ""error"" along with my groceries. As I was trying to figure out why it was on the list, I received a text message stating that my order was rescheduled for the next day at 6:30 am, even though the website was already telling me that the shopper was in transit to bring me the groceries.I called the instacart customer service because I checked my bank to see that I had been charged for the original amount of my purchase of $150, on top of the $180 that I believe is from the ""error"", even though they rescheduled my order. The lady told me that there was an outage in the store. Which didn't make sense to me because the shopper didn't have any problem checking out and charging my card. She was already on her way to dropping off the groceries. It took customer service a while to really figure out what the problem was. I didn't feel comfortable with how the situation was handled, because all I was told was that she was going to leave a note for the next day that the order was going to be shopped, for the extra amount that I was charged (the ""error"" of $180) to be refunded to me. I told her I want to cancel my order and I also want to leave a bad review and block the shopper in charge of my order. The shopper never notified me about any 'outage' in the store, nor did she notify me that she won't be able to deliver the groceries. She also failed to mention anything about the ""error"" charge of x2 $75. There was no communication between the shopper and myself. By the time I wanted to contact her to see what was going on, the order had been rescheduled to the next day, and I had no way of contacting her.I did get my refund, but that was before I was charged from instacart for 3 separate payments. I still don't understand how it happened, but I was charged $150 for my original order, $180 for no reason apparently, and then another $150 the next day when the order has been cancelled. It seems that there was a mistake, and they assumed that I was still going to carry out my order.Because of this incident, I had to go without a week of food. I had to wait for the money to transfer back to my bank. My family ended up having to eat at my mom's in the meantime.Long story short, that is one of the worst experiences I had with instacart. I will not be using this app or any other online shopping site from now on."

And, I already know folks will jump on here and tell me to 1. Try it again! 2. Be flexible 3. It’s just me and call me a Karen...but, I’m not thrilled at all with today. The first time I ordered through Instacart $70+ and the order was seamless at Publix. Great shopper and I received everything from Publix without a hitch. Today...garbage!  I ordered 11 things and everything had to be changed out with the shopper who this wasn’t his fault. Publix had nearly nothing I paid for and ordered. Items were replaced with other name brands, smaller sizes and much more expensive. Hell, I was swapped a piece of Salmon the size of a playing card for $7!  I contacted the store manager at Publix and he told me items jump off the shelves and I received best matches of what remained. $55 was the original cost of my 11 items that ended up being over $70. Recommend Instacart update their site as items deplete shelves or what is truly available at these stores as this is not a Publix error. I will not use Instacart, again.

Darin tried to explain to me that it's not his fault that he was running behind but that has car was having problems and continued to cut off or something to that manner. I tried to understand and calmed down only for Darin to start yelling at me that his navigation took him to the wrong building, claiming that that was not his fault either.

However, nothing was adjusted. So I called to inquire today and request a refund on the difference. I was told that is ""normal"" and that I would receive a ""one-time courtesy refund"" for the difference. I had to know more because if charging an additional $14 (on top of the 5.67 service fee and tip) is normal practice then I don't want to use this service in the future. Well the man I chatted with, Darrel Jason, proceeded to chat in a very condescending and unsupportive manner using all caps and making me feel like I was an idiot for not understanding this ridiculous policy. I eventually called into the company and spoke with a nice women. Again I was told this was policy but she actually handled the call professionally and never made me feel inferior. Basically, the company doesn't charge you what they actually pay for the groceries, you pay the estimated price you see online.

Today 10.28.2020 (this evening). $100 order placed at 5:15-5:30 pm. Shopper started fairly quickly. Shopping complete by 6:30 PM. No contact from shopper. 7:02 pm I contacted shopper because it said ""delivery in progress.  Shopper said the grocery store would ""not let her check out"" and she would have to cancel my order.  Called Instacart who said I'm sorry (again) and contacted shopper who told them she was having trouble with her app. Delivery now has to be scheduled for tomorrow morning even though my grocery store is open until 10 PM.  Bottom line, this app has gone to s***, shoppers don't care to make sure your order has right sizes, quantities and your items are in the right bags.

I was out for 5 hours yesterday after after my regular day job shopping for other people using my own gas while being cold. It is not fair to me that i cant cash out the money i made.

Instacart 'promises' IN WRITING that shoppers will be forgiven for less than 5 star ratings due to app issues or other things which are out of their control BUT they DO NOT follow thru on that ever !!!  They tell you that you have to complete more and more batches (that are ridiculously long distant and low paying) in order for poor ratings to be removed.  Basically they use people and dispense of them on a regular basis because they are grotesquesly self serving and couldn't care less about the people who make it possible for them to make money.

I ordered a Costco prescription delivery through them and they refused to give me the medication because I lost my driver’s license, but I showed them the government-issued interim document temporarily serving as my license until I get a new one. They told me they “need the card itself. Well - this is my card for now you morons. It’s similar to the concept of temporary tags when you purchase a new vehicle. For all intents and purposes, the interim document issued my by state’s motor vehicle administration is my license and my ID card. When I called customer service, they told me the shopper should have given me the prescription, apologized and sent a new shopper. Guess what? The 2nd shopper refused to give me my prescription medication because I didn’t have my license card, again!! The shopper called their support number and a woman told me they can’t give me the medication without my ID card. Are you kidding me?So I called, again, and was told again, that the shopper was supposed to give me the medication. Now, I have to wait another day to get my prescription and I’m assuming the 3rd shopper will likely refuse to give it to me. I will likely have to call customer service to have them handle this shopper when they arrive. So basically, they refused to give me a prescription medication despite me showing a valid government-issued form of identification - that’s a very serious matter. I’m wondering whether it’s a legal offense. What if someone depends upon a medication to survive and they refuse to give it to them because they lost their ID? Absolute insanity. I am transferring all of my prescriptions to a competitor and will probably have to pay a higher price. You’ve just lost a customer for life, Instacart.

Today after my delivery, I noticed for the first time that a paper receipt was in my grocery bag.  My total came to $128.31.  Instacart emailed me my final receipt after delivery and I was charged $167.41.  I went back and added up my delivery fee, service fee and my tip to my driver.  The total should have been $154.37.  Where did the extra $13.04 go?  Good question.  So I reached out to Instacart help line directly.  Here's what they said.  Nothing.  I asked over 6 times where the extra money went.  Who got it?  The retailer?  The driver?  Instacart?  I was passed from one person to another and not one of the people would answer this question.  Now I understand that some grocers inflate the price a little for groceries through this service.  I'm fine with that.  But when my paper receipt shows an amount, that's what the retailer charged.  Otherwise, my receipt would show differently.  Now I'm wondering exactly how much I have overpaid in the last year with this ""fluff"" that no one at Instacart seems to know where it goes?  This is fraud.  Their site mentions a possible overage for items based on the store, but the store regulates that, not Instacart.  Now I know why they tell their drivers to NEVER leave a paper receipt with the delivery.  So beware!!  On top of delivery fee, service fee, and tip, they are somehow adding ""fluff"" and seem to be at a loss when I ask them where that money went.

At first it was great and so convenient as I also have kids. I'm not sure what has been going on the last few deliveries, but they have been aweful. They constantly put back items as ""out of stock"". Like I mean simple things that all grocery stores have. My first issue was with the black beans. Oh my where do I start. I was making black bean soup so I ordered you know black beans. I was home with my sick kid and he wanted some fruit so I also ordered a watermelon. Mind you I just picked one up from the same store 2 days prior. The shopper returns the beans and says out of stock. He also does the same with the watermelon. He never even got a replacement. I have a hard time believing there are absolutely, positively no black beans in the entire supermarket. No other brand, not canned, not frozen, like nothing. Really? He also put back the watermelon. I was so mad. I know he was lying. I dont know why or how that benefits him but since my kid was sick, I turned around and did another instacart for the 2 items. So another person delivered the items 20 minutes later. Go figure. To keep a long story short, this madening thought process happened again with another shopper regarding pepperoni. He put it back as out of stock. I messaged him and said to just grab some from the deli. I am familiar with the store so I know where the bagged ones are and the fresh ones. I told him exactly where to find both. He said ok and then proceeded to return the item. This was infuriating as I was making pizza for my kid. So there are no pepperoni in the entire grocery store. There is a pepperoni drought. Seriously. If you can't find an item just ask. Fast foreword to today. I did a big box store for just 3 items. I figured it's a small order. No big deal. I ordered salmon, and haddock. And paper plates. Do you know they shopped for like 2 seconds and proceeded to cancel my order saying all were out of stock. So a big box store with a huge seafood area has ablsolutely positively no salmon or haddock or fish at all right? They never responded as I messaged them. I could maybe kinda see the paper plates (not really) but fish out of stock. Like this store has a giant seafood area. I live in MA by the way, so saying the store is out of fish is like saying the beach is out of water. Some of the shoppers were really good. But the ones that are bad really ruin it. They act like they are doing you a favor instead of being hired to do a job. I love all my guys out there but the Male shoppers refuse to look. If they cant find something they instantly put it back. No alternative, no asking an employee, nothing. I really wanted to like the service but sorry I'm done."

They informed me that my order was big and they only had 1 1/2 hours in a couple ways and when texting me about replacement items I was told they were on short time and couldn’t take too much time on an item. I was also told that due to my large list that they would need help bringing the groceries up to my apt. I reassured them there was an elevator and told them I was under quarantine. He told me he still needed my help. 2 hours later and several texts about replacement items the cart was abandoned. At 7:07 I was contacted by a new shopper. I specifically asked if this order was still going to be delivered this evening or the next day. I was told it would still be delivered tonight. I told the shopper I hearted her because I was so thankful! Between 7:07And about 9:48pm she shopped, we texted, great. At 9:48 out of nowhere I was sent an email that my delivery was rescheduled for tomorrow. When I called Instacart, I was told it was abandoned again and that I will have to spend hours reshopping yet AGAIN tomorrow morning and they are “sorry”. I politely told the very nice customer service lady that I have now spent over 7 hours on this today and tonight and star eyes a recipe for some of the groceries promised me to still arrive. I asked what their solution to this nightmare was?

That was August.  Never even had the courtesy of a reply.  Now all complaints (and there were a number) seem to have been removed from their website.An hour after we received the order (and the beer) another Instacart driver brought the same order, so evidently the driver didn't say he'd delivered an order here, got questioned and lied about us.

I ordered it and was at my door step within an hour and the person who delivered it made sure they messaged me saying it was there with a photo and was overall extremely nice and pleasant. After that is when the personal shoppers started to get worse, they weren’t all terrible, but every time I ordered my orders started taking longer and kept getting delayed. Then the last person who made me get rid of this app was driving around in circles around the complex (not in it, but the neighborhood around it) took her two hours to get my order purchased, then about another 30 minutes to try and find my apartment that she was driving past the whole time. I’m not sure if it was her GPS or because she’s doesn’t know this area, but when we were chatting she seemed not very nice and was blaming me essentially and thought I put in the wrong address. It was not the wrong address, she just had a lot of issues; every other personal shopper never once had an issue finding my apartment in the slightest (I've ordered for a total around 5 times). I was so impressed with the first employee I thought I came across my new favorite app, sadly it’s mostly just a bunch of high school and college kids not really caring about giving at least decent customer service (this is coming from a recently prior college kid myself who have also hated my customer service jobs, yet tried to give great service because it’s not the customer’s fault you hate your job, except for the rude ones of course).

I finally called to cancel the order after he pushed back delivery time from 8 pm to 9:15 pm and didn't seem like he might make that either. When I called to cancel they only offered a $5 credit. I managed to get it up to $15 (because what will 5 dollars accomplish) but then saw if I reordered I would now be charged for delivery. I contacted them again and they assured me their credit, the $10 Walmart promo code I used earlier, and the free delivery from earlier would be applied. I placed the order and their credit was not applied. After messaging in again, and talking in circles for a while, they apologized and said the credit can't be applied to the rest of the order.

This was supposed to save me time but instead had me stressed out and checking my phone for hours. It just seems like they do not care and have grown accustomed to giving lackluster service.

I wanted some bottled coffees, which I even messaged them specifically to replace and they got me no coffees. I need these things for a gathering in the morning. I got none of what I ordered.

However thanks to the rating system, even if your overall rating is a 9/10 they leave you with the worst batches dozens of miles away meanwhile the new shoppers gets the best batches since their rating is considered a 10/10 even though they never delivered or been rated.

Why is the total for my groceries more than what was paid in the store? When I reached out to customer service and asked these questions, all they said was “some merchants choose to make the Instacart price more than in store prices”. Oh ok so Instacart not only makes money off the service fees but also in the difference of what they actually pay when they shop for me and what they decide to show prices for on the Instacart app!? How is this ok? So I paid $18 more just to have my groceries delivered to me rather than go to the store myself. That was my dumb mistake. Not to mention the shopper did not even get all my items.

I spent approximately two hours placing the order and then another seven hours going back-and-forth with someone who was texting me about items that were out of stock and substitution options avail which I appreciate the fact that they were notifying me of what items were out of stock however it would’ve been much faster for me to go to the store myself. I literally Wasted my entire first day of vacation with my 12 best friends dealing with this order. Then the items were delivered to our vacation rental without any type of notification two hours later than they were supposed to be delivered and left on the hot porch in the 96° Florida sun and most of the items went bad on top of the fact that the meat they delivered us was either already expired or about to expire that day or the next day. They delivered chicken that was green and corn that was rotten etc. Many items were left off of our order Including steaks, they sent the wrong solo cups, they omitted sugar for my order and substituted ground chicken for ground turkey without asking and sent us two jars of spaghetti sauce instead of the four that we had ordered and so many other things. I contacted them immediately and their solution was to deliver the missing items to us the next day by 10 AM. If I needed the items the next day I would’ve placed an order for that day. This ruined our plans for cooking dinner for the evening. Then the next day the order that was supposed to be delivered at 10 AM got changed to 11 AM and then I got a text message that they couldn’t deliver it until after 1 PM and I wasn’t going to sit at the house all day waiting for this order on my vacation. I spent over 30 minutes on the phone with customer service. they said that they only have one delivery person available in the area and that the only option was for them to come after 1 PM or for them to give me a partial credit on my account. I asked them to refund my account for the missing items and after much arguing and rudeness from the customer service agent they said they would but they never did and it has been 9 days. I asked to speak to a manager and they refused. They charged me a $44 delivery fee and $44 tip for a total of $88 and they refuse to refund that amount even though I had to spend two hours placing the order, seven hours back-and-forth texting regarding substitutions, an hour or so at least on the phone the next day dealing with this and then I had to spend two hours driving to the store in traffic and returning the rotten meat and then replace the items that were omitted or exchanging the wrong ones that were received. I could have saved myself a lot of time and money and gone to the store myself in the first place. Lesson learned. I will never ever use this service again! it was my first experience and it was a terrible one. This company is a complete waste of time and money. Do not deal with them."

I had one item refunded but I am missing 5 other items that I didn't receive a notification stating that the items were not in stock. Long story short, I can't get a refund for my missing items through Instacart.

https://ca.trustpilot.com/reviews/5f59cb0c02e8570650b5eeb4,aw,1 star: Bad,40% markup for disappointment and several mistakes,"Placed an instacart order for Wegman’s and encountered multiple problems. For one, 6 out of the 20 items ordered were replaced with different products all of which were NOT comparable. The most bothersome was the order for turkey sausage was replaced with “italian sausage” made with pork. Another product was for chicken thighs which I requested the bulk pack that was significantly cheaper than buying the smaller packs, but was instead given two of the smaller packs and charged the higher price. Also requested a bulk pack of 6 peppers but it was replaced with only a 3 pack and charged the more costly price. The shopper/instacart also believes sweet potato wraps are comparable to wraps made with rice flour. Whatever, not as a big a deal as replacing turkey with pork. Organic chicken stock was also replaced with regular chicken stock and charged a higher price. The only replacement I was ok with was for corn tortillas. However, they also charged me a higher price than the one I had requested. Another problem was Wegmans also listed bags of cole slaw as 2 for $3.49 but was given only 1 for $3.49. That is either very deceptive selling/pricing or a glaring mistake that instacart makes impossible to have corrected. All these problems could be forgiven if the prices were fair. However, not only do they markup a significant portion to pay for “someone else shop”, but they also charge an additional service fee AND delivery fee AND additional tips for the delivery driver. The store receipt had a final price of $99 but my order total paid to instacart was $138. With a 40% markup, I expect my order to be correct with zero disappointment in the order I placed. Needless to say, I will not be using instacart again in the future unless significant improvements are made and all the problems are addressed. I will also be recommending everyone avoid instacart due to these problems I experienced."

They must have psychics working at InstaCart to be able to put through the exact amount of my order a day before it was actually shopped. And to clarify, this was NOT  a pending pre-authorized amount. Then, on the day of the shop, I was double charged for the same order that I had been charged for the day before. These fraudulent charges have not been resolved. An email sent by an InstaCart associate about these fraudulent charges was an image of the receipt for the order, and there was no acknowledgment of the fraudulent charges.

The first, I asked for 10lbs of meat to be wrapped in 2lb increments. Just like I do every single week. I got to 5lb slabs of meat. Which I had to go and buy a food scale in order to be able to divide it into 2 lb increments. Second order, I asked for one full bunch of bananas and three organic avocados. I got one single measly banana, and three regular avocados, in which I have to go back tomorrow and exchange. Seriously. Every single month it just gets worse. I've had it.

Shoppers who used to take the extra time to pick good produce and check expiration dates have been quitting in droves just because this gig is dead.  Sometimes, shoppers will accept their last batch as ""severance pay"" The only ones left these days are the newbies and the truly desperate.IC has been very aggressive combining orders at a same store, producing batches that require much more work to keep things separated across between two or three separate orders.  Of course the pay is not much better than shopping a single order with similar item counts.  Unlike IC who get to pocket three sets of fees but pay the shopper only once.  Any halfway experienced shopper will ignore those batches.  What's worse, orders with good solid tips tend to be combined with ones that have $2 or no tip at all.Another thing is that IC often ""sells"" items that are just plain out of stock at the store.  No, I'm not going to track down a manager to find out if your favorite brand is there if the app shows me an approved substitute right there on the shelf.  Don't blame the shoppers for IC selling items the store doesn't have.  It's just as frustrating for us since we get paid only a flat fee per order and ANYTHING that adds time comes out of our pockets.When a shopper only gets $15 or less for an order with 30+ different items, don't expect that person to go the extra mile."

On Monday I got an alert on my phone that my account had been deactivated because of fraud. I called them in a panic because I knew that I had done nothing fraudulent, and I was looking forward to a busy week. Nobody would talk to me, I had to wait for an email from the fraud department. They requested a receipt from me which I sent them knowing that would clear me. The email response was that after careful research they had determined that they were going to deactivate my account permanently. I wrote to them a number of times asking them to please tell me what I had done… Knowing that I had never done anything fraudulent. There were times when I bought things for people that I forgot to put on my card that you used for payment, and I paid for the items that they had requested with my own money. Again I had amazing reviews. I threaten them with a lawsuit, because I had sought legal aid and the attorney said I definitely had a case due to deformation of character. I sent them an email telling them that… Still no response. They are the most unethical fraudulent company there is. They overcharge the customer and they under pay the driver.

First of all, instacart is the only job function that has a shopper rating system but the customers can not pick a shopper based off those ratings. As a result, if a customer is unhappy with a replacement item (which instacart picks for the customer), then that customer can leave a poor rating on a shopper that did everything right just because they can. This also deprives the customer of the ability to pick and choose a highly rated shopper because shoppers are picked at random, so really, the shopper rating system is irrelevant and does absolutely nothing except screw over the shopper based on the opinion of a random customer. Instacart for some reason treats any rating below 5 stars as a very poor rating which ends up affecting the shopper in such a negative way where the shopper won’t be able to get any order above $10 FOR TWO WEEKS (usually an average batch is about $25). An instacart employee should not be experiencing this form of “punishment”, for lack of a better term, due to a review that really serves no purpose at all. What’s worse is that instacart doesn’t have a direct line or email contact to solve all of these juvenile and irresponsibly issues with their system. The customer service aspect of instacart ESPECIALLY for the shopper is so poorly ran, it’s embarrassing, my 14 year old sister can do a better job. If any instacart manager (if that position even exists) sees this rating please contact me, since your company does so well with poor reviews from your customers, maybe you can do something about a poor review from your own employee :)"

The first text my daughter received from her shopper seemed to be system generated and it alerted her to the fact that the shopper was in the store. That was a nice touch. The second text was a random picture from the shopper placing some zucchini in the cart. Okay, would have been more impressed had she ordered zucchini but the personal touch was ""nice."" Then my daughter received a stream of additional texts--based on the number of substitutions required we began to wonder if the shopper was in the right store. And the products that they were suggesting as substitutions made me question whether the shopper had ever actually shopped in a grocery store before or functioned as an adult within our society. The delivery itself went fine. My daughter got about half the items she had ordered (at one point she just started canceling items instead of trying to explain why the recommended substitutions were not quite right). So I guess she can get to work on disinfecting her room with the can of Pledge wood polish they gave her instead of the requested multi-purpose cleaner, and then she can look into using Amazon Fresh."

Product after product showed similar differences. To shop at Bjs one needs a membership card and that number has to be given to instacart. Instacart told me that I can't get the discount price on sale items, even tho they are loaded onto my membership card because instacart 'doesn't have an arrangement' with Bjs.

I had to find out this dirty trap because the recent shopper left the receipt in the box by accident. In this round, the original Costco bill was $165 while the final Instacart bill was $213! $48 dollars, on top of the service fee + tip + membership free I am already paying. Not mentioned the tax was calculated based on the final markup bill. When I confronted their representatives, all I got was scripted boilerplate-text response, saying the price is determined by Costo not them. So I challenged them: who got the markup dollars, Costo or Instacart? The agent dodged the question again, saying something like they need money to pay for infrastructure etc. NO Instacart at Costco. If you are that rich to toss away $50 dollars per shopping trip, you can send your butler to do it!"

I have been using Instacart for quite some time..….it has been pretty good except for them being out of stock of a lot of items and a few spotty shoppers...well today they took it to a whole other level.  I always tip AFTER they drop the groceries off because that's how a tipping system works anywhere.  Well today I get a call from the shopper BEFORE he even started shopping he asked me where his tip was!!! I couldn't believe it!!!! Then asked if I wanted him to show me how to add a tip or he could cancel the service.  How unprofessional can you be!?!?!?  So I cancelled my order because I didn't want this clown coming to my house and preceded to email customer service with the same information I provided here.  They respond with this generic message about how to add a tip afterward.   They didn't even read my complaint! Then they have the gall to send a follow up email asking how they did in solving my problem!!!!! This company is a joke.

Every order that I have placed with them has a problem associated with it. The shoppers are inattentive and often fail to deliver what is requested because they do not adequately read the labels and ensure that they select the correct item. Without fail, multiple items will be unavailable/out of stock and when you request a substitution they will select a replacement that I did not authorize. I have received items that have been either damaged in the store or in transit. The help desk is not helpful and they have representatives that are unable to communicate effectively via telephone. If there is a problem with the charges pending upon your payment mechanism it can take an excessive number of business days to get sorted and until then the charges applied can lock up your banking account.Were there another delivery service that actually provided better service, I would switch in an instant.I cannot, in good conscience, recommend Instacart to anyone."

The second was that the shopper found almost everything I ordered out of stock.  Why doesn't this show up on the order list?  The third time the primary reason I ordered was to get one item not available at other stores.  It showed in stock on the web site and I made the order along with other things.  The first text back from the shopper was that particular item was out of stock.  I canceled the whole order at that point and was surprised when the shopper (after acknowledging the cancellation) showed up with the other stuff at my door.  Everything screws up with Instacart.

I hope Instacart realizes how serious this problem is, that yes this will affect instacart's bottomline once too many customers are irritated by the influx of low quality shoppers who use these 3rd party bot apps, and that instacart WILL LOSE it's customers and good quality honest shoppers to competitors if it does NOT act quickly!!!

Shoppers using 3rd party bot apps that ignores customer ratings and screens orders before it gets to honest shoppers who don't use 3rd party bot apps continues to allow the low quality shoppers to be a main presence which is unfair to both the customers and the honest hard working shoppers.

Again, haven't even received my order yet and I'm anticipating an argument at the door as I see that the responses provided by the shopper are hugely inconsistent with the receipt. Based on reviews, any adjustments through customer service are going to be less than fun.Review update: The shopper dumped everything at my front door, knocked and then ran.  Many of the items were unwanted alternatives which I had no clue he was choosing.  Confirming I was billed $90 for the $40 steak...not that I was even interested in $40 steak but, I get it, it's Costco.  Not sure how he came up with a price of $90 though!  I sense the drivers make money from order sizes or something.  These kind of increases are NOT easy to overlook!  Find another sucker, it won't be me.  Instacart refunded me $100 for all the wrong items and overcharges (on the same day) so that was good.  Even this, according to other reviews may be an exception. I hope they fire the shopper, he seems to be in it for all the wrong reasons."

https://ca.trustpilot.com/reviews/5f259da41a5a690a041d5dd6,SP,1 star: Bad,If I could give it no stars I would.,"If I could give it no stars I would.I have a medically fragile person in my home who requires 24/7 care, has lots of Drs appts, and we are amidst a pandemic. It’s unsafe to shop in public even if I had the free time to, so we’ve had to depend on Instacart to keep my family safer.First off, the customer service is deplorable. If you report a problem, you don't get a reply for days, but they have no problem sending ‘bot mail’ to rate the missing reply...which ends up being a dead end. There are significant systemic issues with communication and order accuracy that are unrelated to out of stock items.It’s been 2 weeks since the last issue with no resolution or refund for over $100 in spoiled food due to errors with delivery timing and location which were clearly stated when the orders were placed.Problem # 1 is you can’t get a real person: you have to go through a maze I’d dead end faq’s and chat bots that don’t address the issue and take longer than the ordering process to navigate.  Then you get to an actual email address...or you can wait on the phone till you have to hang up and get back to life.Email provides a trail, but each exchange is with a different rep who keeps asking for details already provided earlier in the same thread...when they already have electronic access.  In other words, they’re asking us to do their jobs for them.I sent an itemized dated, chronological accounting of the ruined items for 2 orders yet they continue to ask me to repeat the same info. Asking for a supervisor is also useless.In short:  they don’t care, and once they have your money, it’s gone, unless you report it to your bank/card provider and add on that battle.Instacart needs a lot of work to....work well.  The app also freezes and lacks details the website has, there are time delays in communication we have no control over, I have no idea what the shopper sees, but I do know my timeframe and delivery info works on my end.  Using Instacart is also costly. Here are some other FYI’s including fees and tips: You pay to join, for any upgrades, and there's another fee applied to each order. They add on a minescule shop/delivery tip automatically with the option for an increase up front (to enlist better service?). I tipped 20% in advance hoping for that with plans to tip more for great service and I still got bad service.  If you wait till after the delivery to tip more are you more likely you get bad service?  I do know you don't get refunds on tips...or anything else, so basically you're at the mercy of whoever gets your order (an Uber-like system...which is about quantity rather than quality with the “tip in advance” system).There have been significant issues with delivery timing and orders being left in the wrong place in full sun, hours before delivery in 90 degree heat resulting in ruined and unsafe perishables, and weeks later, no resolution or refund despite numerous tries.It takes just as long (or longer) to place the order with Instacart as it does to do the shopping yourself.  They offer choices of delivery times that are ignored, so you will need to place the order and wait at home until it is delivered or they will leave it at the door in the blazing sun in 80+ degree heat whenever it suits them. That means if you place the order at 8 AM for your dinner ingredients to arrive at 5 PM after all of your Drs appointments so nothing spoils, it won't happen that way, you will need to throw away said items, and you will NOT be reimbursed.  So, you will need to budget for the loss...if you can afford to.Each of those botched orders has resulted in $75 of unreimbursed tips, fees, and food we had to discard.  Can you afford that?The accuracy of your order is dependent upon the shopper/delivery person and available stock, so you'd better hope you get a someone pats attention and cares or you will get whatever they feel like making the effort for.  We need organic items due to fragile health. I tip at least 29% in advance for the added effort.  There have been many unauthorized subs we cannot eat, and in addition to the above issues we've also received part of other people's orders in error.There has not been a single order that has been 100% accurate regardless of the day of the week or time of day, the amount of the tip, and communication about substitutions are dependent on the integrity level of the shopper and whether the app is working properly or crashes.Its' way too much $$$ - After the math is done, ASIDE FROM FEES AND TIPS using Instacart has been a 50% more than shopping ourselves (plus the time to place the order), which is way too expensive for my family. I wish there were a better cempetitor.  At this point, I am going to pay a neighbor to help us. At least I will know what I'm getting, if they are healthy, and it will just be one fee."

I also ordered a few different fruit flavored Fresca 12 packs.     They substituted with unknown named brand  sugar free root beer?  There were other issues also.  I am DONE.   I recently made an order through Amazon Fresh to test them out and see if I could get my missing stuff.    Got every single thing I ordered.  No substitutions.  I'm guessing they have a better computer system that only lets you order what they actually have.  Maybe the other grocery stores need to get up to speed.

Over half the items on our list we know for a fact are in stock every week, and they substitute them. And what they do substitute, is either not even close to the product we asked for, or it's a much more expensive item. The ""convenience"" of this ""service"" is not worth the headache of whatever bag of mystery they leave for you. Don't use Instacart."

They charged $9.49 delivery fee, $10.11 service fee.

And they advertise many of them as as part of their store contract list. Yet when i contacted superstore about this they said instacart sets the price and instacart says the store sets the price . Some one is making large profits from seniors who need a service like this and the cost difference is not clearly states anywhere on their sites unless you really dig around to find the pricing policy We still pay. Then you tip - fair enough - that goes to the shopper. But what you do NOT usually see is the higher prices you pay for the items you buy which is somewhat understandable. A few times my shopper has inadvertently left the actual receipt (not the one on the Instacart site) in my bag. Comparing the actual receipt to my receipt paid to Instacart today here are the numbers: Instacart receipt shows I was charged $149.46 (includes a 15% tip and service fee for delivery). But looking at the actual paper receipt left in the bag, my shopper (Instacart) PAID $113.71. That means for the convenience today of me not going to the store, I paid $35.75 - or 24%. Nearly a quarter of a percent more for this convenience.that is a big markup even for a premium service.have contacted both company's about this and each say the others are reasonable for the pricing after doing some research i found out the they split the commerce  i feel they are ripping of seniors and people with disabilities the policy for pricing is hidden very well in the FAQ and when you check out their site it has a list of store they contract with superstore clams they are a 3 party and have nothing to do with the pricing yet when you are on their site it says try delivery with our PARTNER instacart Revenue is also generated through two types of partnerships.First, Instacart partners with grocery chains to offer the service in their stores. The revenue generated is shared between both companies.Brand PartnershipsInstacart also partners with specific brands to offer discounts and deals in a special section of their interface. It’s a new model of advertising in a way.seems to me that would mean superstore would have  alot to do with them as would insatacart would with the stores listed on their sites  I am not sure if this is worth looking into but it defiantly is deceiving consumers"

One of the shoppers did not deliver several of the items that I ordered and paid for, and I had to call Instacart to request a refund for those items, in addition to having to drive to the store to purchase those items, which defeated the purpose of using instacart in the first place.  The last shopper that delivered an order, before I decided to discontinue using this service, not only failed to include several items that I bought and paid for, she also added a $15.99 wine cooler mixer pk to my order, and did not deliver, which means she kept it for herself.  I once again had to request a refund from Instacart.  I requested this refund 2 weeks ago, and as of today I still have not received the refund on my debit card.  Instacart needs to have a better checks and balance system for their shoppers so that these issues don't happen.  Their premise is convenience, but when you have to constantly request refunds, and drive to the store to purchase items that the shoppers forget to include, it's not very convenient."

I’ve used them 3 times to deliver groceries and will never use them again.The first time they delivered right to my condo door which is great, but not when nobody notifies you. I was home when the groceries were delivered apparently but the driver didn’t knock or provide any notice so the groceries (which included meat and eggs) sat on my doorstep for 2 hours! I called to complain and they credited me $10 for the inconvenience.The second time, they delivered instead to our condo concierge desk and again didn’t let me know that the groceries were delivered so again they sat there for 2 hours. They gave me another $10 credit. I decided I would give them one last try. This time, the grocery bill from Loblaws was included with the groceries which they’re apparently not supposed to do. I was shocked at the overpricing I saw by comparing the Loblaws receipt to the Instacart receipt. Literally almost every single item was charged a higher price than on the Loblaws receipt by  0.50 to $2/item. One item was overcharged by more than $20! I got some fish that was charged at $26.60 by Instacart but was only $5.57 on the store receipt. This is robbery!!When I called to complain, the customer service rep tried to justify the price gouging by telling me that they had to do this to pay their staff!! But you’re already paying a delivery charge plus a tip for the driver. This is cheating. Crazy! Ridiculous!! Will never use them again. They have agreed to refund me $30 but we’ll see if that actually happens. In addition to the overcharging they also screwed up on several items. I ordered a small amount of fresh ginger and instead they gave me 3 huge pieces. On another order I requested  0.9 kg of sweet potatoes (approximately $4) and instead they gave me 2 large 2.25 kg bags that were almost $18!!I will never use them again."

OK, COVID is a problem getting through to Instacart by phone (understandable). As a matter of fact, you can't. The only way to contact them is through an internal message to them sent from your account.  If there is a problem with the charge itself, the only way to do this is to press ""other"", if the issue has nothing to do with missing items etc.(All my items were accounted for this week). I also enrolled in their ""Free Delivery trial"". It gives you free delivery for 14 days, at which time you can cancel or continue with a subscription. My final tally (including free delivery) with tax was $261 and change. They list it as ""item total"" and then the tip I added on. That is the entire tally--just the 2 lines for Item Total and Tip. The item total perfectly matched the total on the printed receipt the store gave to the shopper (which I have in my possession) .  All the other surcharges, delivery fees were waived, and not even listed as line items for this order on the Instacart website.. I checked on the total 2 minutes later, and the bill jumped $30 ! It said the same exact format as the prior (correct) tally:  ""Item total"" plus tip, delivery waived. Somehow, their system jumped the total by $30, which was an obvious system issue on their part. When I contacted them, the pop up says ""An agent will contact you shortly"". Well, they don't !! I had a similar situation 6 weeks ago with them when there was a problem with not getting credited for a BOGO item..I sent them a note through the system (because phoning doesn't work) and they never contacted me !

There is an instacart shopper who DOES NOT wash her hands after using our restroom. She has had 4 complaints already. I happened to be sanitizing the restroom today and she came out of a stall after having flushed the toilet and she just walked right out the door and returned to shopping for people's orders. Absolutely disgusting. I dont mean to be a snitch but with everything going on and with all of the safety precautions we take at our store, for her to do that in front of me was an absolute slap in the face. So beware when you get your groceries, especially if you use instacart as a safe means to get your food because you have a compromised immune system.

Customer service agents were very rude and short when I requested a manager-- would not recommend this site for any delivery services.  I waited over 30 mins to speak to a manager to then be disconnected.   A ""manager"" called me and apologized but at this point, I requested a full refund.

Now that states have opened up, I'm less tolerant.  I want Instacart to meet the basic expectation they claim: deliver an item found to my doorstep and list the items you can't find and don't charge me for them.  I find the shoppers very helpful when in the store--but the RESULT is a bad one--consistently missing items. Then pandemic is NOT an excuse any longer -- I'm fine with delayed delivery--I don't care about that. I am irritated at the consistent errors. I think shoppers are either skimming off the top (taking groceries paid for by the consumer) or there is gross and systemic incompetence at fulfilling a basic order.A refund is not a solution. The problem is that Instacart is creating an expectation by stating they have found items and then not delivering them. So you are consistently disappointing the customer and creating the expectation that we will be disappointed which turns to frustration and bad reviews which remain forever, tarnishing your brand/reputation.

Each time my order was to be delivered from 1-3 p.m. because I'm not available before 12 noon. Usually that gives me plenty of time to interact with the shopper and ensure I'm charged for what I want. When I checked my phone at noon this last time the shopper had shopped the order at 10 IN THE MORNING--3 HOURS before it was to be delivered. Despite the fact I ordered no fat refried beans, they were replaced with traditional refried beans with lard, which I can't eat. The shopper repeatedly ignored texts and chats from me to get the correct item in the hour before it was to be delivered, and did the same when Instacart support tried to contact her. Worst of all, to get refried beans that I could eat, the company was trying to make me place ANOTHER ORDER WITH A $35 minimum--which is too pricy for three cans of beans. I was on the phone with support for hours listening to their lies about why the shopper wouldn't get the right item, getting hung up on by two of their agents, etc. I finally got someone to agree to a redelivery the next day. And what happened again? The shopper selected the beans with lard in it. Even worse, this order was to be delivered from 3-5 p.m. and I got a text shortly after 12 p.m. saying the shopping began. Before I could get my laptop going to check the shopper's progress, there was another text 1 MINUTE LATER STATING HE WAS CHECKING OUT and the order couldn't be replaced. I'm convinced Instacart had him get the wrong item on purpose and leave me no time to react  just to spite me for the previous day. So then it was 12 noon and 3 HOURS BEFORE THE ORDER WOULD BE DELIVERED, and the shopper--and all of Instacart's managers--refused to get me the right item. Never will I use this service again: they care nothing about their customers or the money you spend with them."

The shopper explained cart can b in middle of aslie so everyone can get to it. The shopper moved the cart by 2 in to get the chicken.  Full shopper didn't care. then threatened there life and instacart knows about it and instacart will let customers have people like her continue to deliver and put the customers at risk. Thats enough for me to know that instacart has no value in the customers safety and will let them continue to act like this get away with it.

First off, we should not have to rely solely on tips to make our money since the customers can take their tips back; it would turn a $30 order to actually getting $11, and for working about 2 hours, that's so not worth it. Also the app would be great if we could call customer service and it didn't take forever for them to reply, and if the app didn't constantly freeze and malfunction during orders. This app is really only good when nothing goes wrong, the stores are all stocked up, and you don't have to wait on the customer to review items for replacing, but 80% of the time it isn't a smooth trip, so it's not worth having the app. I really wanted to like this app but it's failed me so many times that it's not worth all the stress and tears that have happened over things that should be simple fixes. The company isn't professional and they low ball all the time on orders, such as getting $7-15 for a big trip. Here are some examples I've had dealing with this company,One order I had, the customer wanted to add two more of an item she already had, the app wouldn't let me do it, so after 30 minutes of messaging with customer service they finally let me add it. Another time I went and the customer wanted to cancel the order, since the main thing they wanted was out of stock, and that took so long and was such a hassle to deal with with the customer service, they ended up reimbursing me $7 for the time wasted there, but that wasn't even worth it and was half the amount the app initially said I would get. Another time I went to costco for 2 orders and the membership numbers wouldn't pop up at checkout (which is what you need to pay) and again I was stuck waiting for customer service to message me after 30 minutes of standing near the cashiers like a freak, and finally they gave me a number that wasn't even the member number so I had no way of finishing the order, and since then I've talked to SO many different customer service reps about it, who are all clueless since the chats delete right away, and now they are threatening my account saying it was MY fault that the app didn't work.There are many more examples but I can't think of them on the top of my head, for how little you get paid, and how much BS you go through please don't get this app, because you will be going through the same sorts of experiences sooner than later. I'm going to apply for Shipt until I can find a real job again because I can't go through this anymore."

I then contact InstaCart back and they then proceed to tell me that they cannot get a hold of the shopper/runner and did I want a credit or a refund the refund which would have placed the money back in my account after a 4 to 5 day hold for product they did not give me.

Expect to get a call center in another country! Communication is less than good and just makes a bad situation worse. As far as the fee's and mark up on the items... hat is a complete joke and big rip off!!!! Here's an example, if the store has something on sale the instacart shopper will get the discount at check out, but it is no passed on to you. I just places an order and received the store receipt. It was emailed to me from the store as I have an account with them. Anyway, Instacart charged me BEFORE tip and service fees $39.69, the store's receipt total was $26.37. That's a mark-up of 50%. Highway robbery. Keep in mind that that does not include the tip and service fee. Then on top of that you are also paying a membership fee.  It wouldn't be so bad if at least you were able to enjoy the service you are paying for instead of being tied to your app while your shopper is shopping because the DO NOT take the time to read your notes.  The best is when they tell you I am new and I don't know how to do something.I have left several messages to have a manager contact me back and nobody has ever done so. I have also tried to get in touch with the corporate office and that hasn't been easy. Clearly they want to hide behind the customer service team. FYI Instacart... customer service can't fix most of your issues. Stop hiding behind them and start listing to the customers or at the very least, call them and see what you can do to help.  I could go on with more issues with them, but at the end of the day they will only fall on deaf ears. It appears that they look at this business like a cash cow.

So for example, Costco charge $9.99 for their Kirkland brand of Irish Cream (🤤) but with Instacart, I would pay $11.50.  So who pockets that money?  When I contact Instacart, they told me vendors will sometimes put higher prices, but dear Instacart, Costco isn't the kind of company to do that, and their price on their Cream has never been that high. I simply don't buy the explanation, and it's a rip-off with all these hidden costs."

When another shopper refused to give me a paper receipt, I contacted to instacart customer service.

First spoke to one rep who REFUSED to remove delivery fee (she said the system wouldn't allow her, but she couldn't explain why) even though I had offer for Free delivery if I spent over $35 and I spent more than TEN TIMES THAT (more than $400).  But she promised me a supervisor would call me back within half an hr. It's been over a month and that call never came. So I called again. Spoke to Lara for about an hour who ALSO promised a callback, and I told her point-blank that I didn't believe it would come. It did NOT. No removal of fraudulent or erroneous fees. No credit for erroneous delivery fees. Or for spoiled products delivered. Etc. And was charged about 57% increase for a single item, REPEAT, 57%!!! and overall, order cost me about a 70% increase over store pricing when adding in all charges. (I was charged about $500 on a $300 order!!) How can this company justify this by pointing out that some items may be priced higher than in-store pricing? YOU OVERCHARGED ME $300 ON A $200 ORDER. THERE IS NO VALID JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS, ESPECIALLY IF YOU WANT TO RETAIN CUSTOMERS LIKE ME WHO NEED TO PURCHASE GROCERIES EVERY WEEK.  I emailed this company a zillion times. Called. Tried chat several times. Got nowhere. Then was told they couldn't help as beyond 7 days of order, EVEN THOUGH I REACHED OUT TO THEM ON THE DAY OF THE ORDER ITSELF. AND/OR THE VERY NEXT DAY. INEXCUSABLE. THEY SEND FORM LETTER REPLIES THAT DON'T EVEN ANSWER THE QUESTION AND JUST SERVE TO AGGRAVATE FURTHER. At this point, I asked for a credit back for my ENTIRE order. Still got zilch. No credit on double-billing. No credit of even $8.99 delivery fee. So, I had to do a charge-back with my cc company, and sent THEM dozens of pages of proof. This company is horrific. Stay far away. Yes, grocery deliveries are tough to get during a pandemic, but there ARE alternatives. Look for them in your city. You'll find them. Good luck.Oh, btw, they've already had lawsuits against them from their OWN employees. Hopefully, there is an attorney out there who will have a HUGE class action lawsuit against this company from the consumers end. When you do so, please contact me so I can gladly join.PS On the web, I read their service fees were ""optional"" (over $22 in my case, not including the added (erroneous) delivery fee or a gratuity) - but when I inquired, they wouldn't give me a straight answer and wouldn't tell me out to opt out. After about 6 emails, I was finally informed that this fee is not optional, but given their deceit/lack of transparency over everything else, I don't know if I believe them - regardless, they did NOT remove it - nor provide any of the other requested, and valid, credits for me."

I accidentally put my order through twice. This was an honest mistake on my part. I immediately initiated a chat with an instacart representative explaining what happened. She understood and was nice enough to refund one of the orders. About a month later someone else from instacart contacted me and threatened me that I could not use instacart again unless I called my bank and reversed the refund that instacart put through. This is unfortunate for Publix, as well as instacart because I'll never shop Publix on line again. The person who contacted me from instacart was extremely rude!

This is not taking care of the customer when the fault is on your company.  Nobody in my home is working due to Covid and now I must figure out a way of feeding my family until we find money again. We will NOT be rolling the dice with Instacart again.  The solution in my eyes is to bring me what was ordered and have the driver pick up the groceries where he dropped them off.  A really good company would throw in a credit towards a future use of their service.  Instacart did none of the above.  Just a simple “ I am sorry for your frustrations”.  poor service when they are at fault.

They are supposed to text you through a chat feature if they can't find an item in your list, with possible replacement suggestions. You can then choose what to do - - replace an item, or strike it from the list. Today, our shopper just replaced items willy-nilly, only notifying us that they had done so, not asking us what to do. They also disregarded a specific request in a note we added BEFORE she began shopping, requesting that a boneless dinner ham NOT be sliced. She replied ""Okay"", but delivered a different brand and it was SLICED. We always tip $10,so my wife gave her the money without checking the order. She also made mistakes on 4 other items. I drove to the grocer and found all the items she'd replaced or claimed were unavailable - - immediately after her delivery! Also, the grocer won't take anything back, and you have no receipt. Only InstaCart can help you, and they don't call or write - - you are stuck with the wrong items.What was once a good service has gone downhill since Covid. My guess is they've added a lot of new shoppers, and are scraping the bottom of the barrel."

I decided to try Instacart in April for the 1st time due to COVID19. I ordered 3 bottles of Jim Beam Maple which is very hard to find and typically sells for $16 to $20 each. Instacart had it at $17 so I ordered 3 bottles. I checked their policy for alcohol delivery which states the delivery person must check the ID & insure the buyer is of age and not intoxicated before physically transferring the alcohol to the buyer.Two hours later the Instacart delivery driver ran up my stairs dropped 3 bottles of the wrong alcohol (Jim Beam Straight Bourbon) which is easy to find and $10/bottle.After the driver ran away I retrieved the package finding they delivered the wrong product. I immediately called customer service to get the correct product exchanged for the one that was delivered or refund my purchase. I was told I cannot return products during COVID19 after delivery has been accepted. I sent them my security video showing their driver never tried to get me to accept delivery of alcohol (which is illegal in CA). They would not refund the $48.75 or deliver the product I actually ordered. They only offered a credit to my account minus the delivery charge and expected me to accept the wrong product. I felt like I wanted to go to Instacart Headquarters in San Jose so I could shove the 3 bottles up the asses of the 3 top people who run Instacart but realized it would not be worth going to jail over this company that has no problem with breaking the law as well as the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced.So, in summary, Instacart expects customers to place orders for products they may or may not deliver but will issue no refunds, take no returns or attempt the correct product so customers should pay for products they did not order.I finally contacted my credit card company tied to Instacart, giving them the evidence of the illegal alcohol delivery and the wrong product, putting Instacart in breach of contract. The credit card company refunded the Instacart charge. Instacart then cancelled my account. I WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH INSTACART EVER ! ! !"

Of course demand would be higher on the weekend; I don't blame Instacart for that. So I order my groceries at the beginning of the week, and I like to select the earliest possible delivery, which is usually in the 8am-9am range.WITHOUT FAIL, every single morning that I am to have my groceries delivered, I get an email saying ""Unfortunately, demand is high right now and your order is late. You can expect your order to be delivered between 10am-12:30pm"" or something to that effect.It's infuriating. Every single time. No exceptions. It's just bad. Why let me choose an early delivery if you literally never fulfill it? I mean it, Instacart has LITERALLY NEVER delivered my groceries on time.One star. Zero if I could."

However, my checkbook and budget is totally off from this withdrawal, in which now I now have to wait for 5 days to be refunded to my account which is causing me problems for my scheduled payments.  I am so not happy and disappointed; but, at least I get my money back. Also, they sent the money through immediately which is more upsetting.

The shopping and delivery portion for us was always great.The ugly side is this. We recently had an order filled by a shopper at Costco. That shopper supplied us with the receipt from Costco. Well it wasn't hard to see that on top of the service fees and monthly fees that Instacart was marking up the price on every item purchased. We were charged over a $140 for an order that only have $96 of groceries. After adding in a good tip, the difference came out to us paying almost $25 mark up on the groceries. If you look on the Website under each retailer you will find pricing policy that simply say prices may be more in some cases. Well its in all cases, and after a 25 minute discussion with the ""help"" desk and the person there telling me how this was about fluctuating market data and that they do their best to stay accurate on prices etc I finally got a straight answer.You place and order, the shopper picks it up using the Instacart account, ringing the groceries up at normal store prices, In this case, Costco bills Instacart the $97. Instacart then bills your account with the marked up groceries. Oh and FYI the shoppers tip percentage is pre mark up. In my conversation they even tried to blame Costco for charging Instacart higher prices. Look everyone has to make a living, and I get it if they need to make some of the profit this way. But BE HONEST, BE UP FRONT, POST YOUR REAL PRICING FORMAT, AND MOST OF ALL PAY YOUR SHOPPERS BASED ON THE SELL PRICES YOU GET. !!Unfortunately while the people shopping and delivering were great and we where more than happy to give them the opportunity to help supplement their incomes this way we have cancelled our Instacart acct on the basis of they are just not honest with their customers or their hard working employees in the field."

Instacart is too expensive. They have a service charge, a delivery charge, sometimes a heavy item charge, and a tip to the shopper (I give 10% to the shopper). In addition, the charges for individual items in the store are marked up way above the price that the store charges. When you add all of these charges up you are paying 40-50% more than if you shopped in the store. Another problem is that they claim that your groceries are kept in a temperature controlled environment until delivered to you. This is not true. Several times I checked the deliveries in the shopper's car  and my packages are just in the store's bags or boxes in the trunk of the car. There is no temperature control and frozen items such as ice cream usually arrive very soft. The service is efficient and the shoppers chat with you regarding replacements, but the price for grocery delivery is outrageously high."

They “credited” the account for this. Which will not matter as they will never get my business again. To my understanding, they charge you a higher amount than your actual order “in case they need to swap for more expensive alternatives” and it gets credited back to your card in the future (when I don’t know). The most frustrating part is I ultimately ordered 102 worth of groceries. In checking my bank account this morning, I was charged TWICE in the amount of 140 for a total of 280 being taken out of my account. Whether this horrible company rectifies this or not is still to be determined. However, I can say the customer service has been beyond horrible in regards to their urgency in keeping their customers informed. I reached out this morning and STILL have not hear back on what the issue is. Do not use this company. Beyond dissatisfied with every step of the transaction."

This is a cost of doing business for Shop Rite and should be born by them, as many who use this service would not shop in these stores in person. This is a fee of 7.92$ for less than a 30$ order. The consumer pays a delivery fee or a subscription fee to Instacart, then a tip...why should they have to pay what should be Shop Rite's responsibility? This is price gouging!

The prices were higher, but the convenience was worth it until recently when their prices sky-rocked into ""price gouging' mode. Items that were a couple of dollars higher than the in-store pricing are now five dollars more than they were a few weeks ago. I once had the ability to select a preferred store location within a certain distance, and shoppers were able to choose which store they shopped at. Now they keep sending all of my shoppers exclusively   to the most poorly stocked and mismanaged store in the entire Publix chain (Sunshine Plaza). The prepared food selections are limited and the food is ALWAYS overcooked. Every time I buy Ice Cream it arrives melted, and looks like it has been refrozen more than once. I have repeatedly contacted CS to complain and request a different Publix location, but they say it is automated, and cannot be changed despite having several Publix stores within five miles of my home. Most are within three miles or less.I have had to place multiple orders on the same day and/or following day to complete my shopping because I rarely receive half my order. I am starting to think this failure is by design since the  minimum purchase amount of $35 per order regardless of whether it is due to missing, wrong, or damaged items. The dollar amount of what's missing is usually around $20, so I have to pad my next order with things i don't really need at the moment. That's some racket they've got going.Yesterday I discovered SHIPT, and I am thrilled with their service. Prices are about the same, and they go to the stores that have the items on my list, My shopper even called some of the stores ahead of time to make sure they were stocked on my regular items and special request.

Didn’t receive Motrin even though I got charged, was given cherry coke when I ordered regular, sugar was out so without even asking and specifying that if it wasn’t available I didn’t want a substitute they gave me a huge bag of sugar substitute, ordered paper plates that were 10 inches wide and when those were out they decided that plates that could barely hold a price of cake were okay to get instead, it was a $200 grocery order and I basically had to go out all over again and pay for everything again. It was a complete mess when I filed a complaint and said for them to contact me to discuss they never did but did refund the cherry coke which totaled .99 cents.

They apparently select the largest tip unless you take the survey and change it before you submit the review.I am disabled and have to shop online. I placed my order at Costco.com, they had Instacart deliver my order. Instacart inflated the total cost by $27.59. It took an hour on hold with Costco and Instacart and they said the receipt from Costco isn’t the real price (although it’s an itemized receipt showing the price of East item. They refused to correct their mistake claiming they were “just following policy). Ripping off Costco customers is company policy. I think the Attorney General will like investigating such a company."

On June 2, 2020 I placed a Publix order thru Instacart.  The order was sopped exactly as placed.  I received all items I ordered.  There were no adjustments.  The  Publix register receipt was in one of the Publix shopping bags.  The total for the Publix items ordered, including tax, was 128.46.  When I accessed my Instacart receipt, Instacart had charged me $139.81.  I expected to pay the delivery charge of $3.99 and a 5% tip and a service fee equal to the tip.... that is the algorithm they use to determine the service fee.  I hold Publix partially responsible for the dishonest business practices of Instacart.  It was Publix who made the decision to form a business relationship with Instacart.  I will be detailing my experience to Publix corp. mgt. as well.  DO NOT ORDER FROM ANY GROCER WHO IS AFFILIATED WITH INSTACART."

A single star review now seems too generous. Since they have returned to deliveries on the same day since COVID-19, the service has been markedly so terrible that I am posting here after giving them three tries: (1) The first Instacart person delivered frozen food that was lukewarm at best and mushy ice cream, all the produce was thrown haphazardly in bags, and of course, missing items (could be the delivery person, could be the store). (2) The second Instacart person emailed (timestamped) us that we would soon get our delivery but then we never got it (we were watching and have Ring), so I called and complained, then our neighbors discovered the items in bags melting on our driveway later that day, even though it was door delivery. (Was he avoiding the Ring time stamp?) The driver apparently also had a magic time reversal machine, as he send an email AFTER my complaint that he had delivered it BEFORE the complaint and 20 minutes before the time of his own, original email stating it was still on its way! Instacart did refund us on that one but they did not clean the stains on our driveway from the spoiled food. (3) This last Instacart person was acceptable in general service some ways, but was not wearing a mask (as per our Ring video), although the produce was now in bags (some were missing), but still less partially thawed frozen items and lots of missing items. Tip amounts don't seem to matter, as I've tried adding a large tip at the beginning OR keeping what the store suggests--neither made any difference in service quality. Instacart needs to train better so that there are shopper/packers and separate delivery persons who must use some kind of storage to keep the items cold and wear masks. The rating system should be public for each delivery person so that the excellent and good workers can fairly rise to the top so that they can be selected and tipped accordingly."

I THOUGHT I was dealing with Wegmans, not InstaCart. However, that turned out not to be the case. I placed a ""Curbside Pickup"" order with Wegmans last night around 8 PM, EST. Then during checkout I felt like they'd pulled a bait and switch, since I was now dealing with InstaCart, not Wegmans. The first thing that caught my eye was the little check box which defaulted to ""Accept Substitutions"". I immediately unchecked that. The next thing that caught my eye was a note at the bottom of my order after checking out, stating that my credit card had been temporarily overcharged with no logical explanation whatsoever as to why. Thirdly, the order was unable to be fulfilled today  because the items (multiple items of the same kind) were out of stock. (I'm just glad I unchecked the ""Accept Substitutions) box.) Furthermore, either Wegmans or InstaCart has a policy that if the curbside order isn't picked up by the end of the day, you don't get your order and you don't get a refund. Finally, there was a note stating that my credit card would be refunded in 5 or more business days. WHAT? The refund should have been immediate. They didn't have the items I'd ordered, the entire process occurred in less than 24 hours, and there's no way in this world they should be able to hold my money, interest free, before issuing a refund. InstaCart is a scam and this entire experience was an epic fail as far as I'm concerned. I not only won't ever deal with InstaCart again, I will think long and hard before dealing with Wegmans again.

I called Instacart first and the young man I spoke with simply deflected blame to Kroger.  I explained to him that it is clear Instacart workers shop for you, so he should not blame Kroger.  If Kroger collected the items and had them waiting for Instacart to pick up, I can see how his explanation might hold water. Also, it is the Instacart worker who is supposed to let Kroger know what they picked up.  Instacart workers usually do not search for your items. It is my impression that in many cases, (not all,) that they quickly go through and pick up what is easy to find. I contacted Kroger about this and the nice person laughed and let me know that she wasn't laughing at me.  I was told that customer service has so many problems and they are constant.  The person told me that they have to refund customers all the time because Instacart workers will actually pick up additional items which were not ordered and charge the customer.  She said that many times, the customer isn't aware.  She said that one time a person ordered tuna and received cat food.  I am in no way stating that there are not some reliable and dedicated workers, but evidently there aren't protections in place for the consumer, and Instacart is not doing enough to correct these issues.

Placed an order for Costco, well over $300 not the first time I have done this, however it will be the last. I have been using Instacart for almost a year. Bought the premium membership and didn’t have any problems until these last 3 months. I agree with other reviewers, Instacart has decided to take advantage of the COVID-19 situation, increasing their fees and hiring unskilled, non trustworthy people to represent their business. Today, the shopper left my order down the street from my home...I’m looking at him live delivery wondering why was he sitting down the street from my house??? Because he was giving my items to someone else! Tried to contact the shopper...no response. I had to check the porch of my neighbors to locate my order. What does Instacart say: “Sorry. We will give you a $10 credit for your next order.” Are you serious? You really think a next order will be coming? Then when I asked about the $54 differences between my receipt and the amount I was charged, I get this generic rehearsed response about Costco charging their customers retail prices instead of wholesale....they never did before! I plan to warn everyone about Instacart scam business. Don’t waste your money or your time. Looking forward to everything going back to normal and their company going out of business."

Let me say that in the climate of Covid19, the way they are getting money from people is worth an email to the Better Business Bureau, which I am sending.  I seem to be having trouble explaining to the agents that I don't owe what they are saying I do.  Firstly, I was receiving a refund for meat that was way over priced and not what I ordered.  The agent said she would refund me $37 but instead, I found out when I phoned today, that it was put as a credit on my account. The agent I spoke with today said he would refund the money but would't listen when I tried to tell him I didn't owe what their receipt states.  So my calculation is as follows:Store sub total - $171.58Instacart fees and taxes - 3.99 + 9.08 + 9.08 (mandatory tip) + Grocery Hst - 1.83 + their taxes 2.00 = 25.98Total receipt - 197.56 - from $230 they took from my account - 32.44 should be returned plus the 37 refund - a total of $69.44 should be returned to my account.

The original guy who was assigned to be my shopper was not leaving my door stating I can adjust the tip now and how his friend makes so much money through getting groceries making up to $50 in tip. It got to the point where I had to shut the door in his face because he was not leaving. I called instacart immediately to let them know what I had just experience and how vulnerable I was that two guys who now have my address refused to leave and I felt very brushed off. They progressed me to the higher level of care, but they only stated "" we will make sure you aren't matched with him again an you can get free delivery for next time"". I informed them there would not be a next time and he should be fired that kind of behavior should be unacceptable!

But when something goes wrong, like the payment card is declined, or they send you an order and the store is not even open, or their App crashes in the middle of shopping, trying to find any help is impossible. Instacart TAKES NO BLAME OR ACCOUNTABILITY for anything. I think if you complain, the same way they deactivate a customer's account, you don't get good orders.

They overprice every product they sell and they justified implying that the different shop sites like Costco, bjs, Publix, etc platform are the ones who overcharge us. But the truth is that a few of the Instacart shoppers include your receipt with your shoppings and it’s way different the price it shows, it goes from $20-$50 or more the difference.  Why a receipt from the store even if they are the ones supposedly charging you more, have the same prices as if you go to the store so the difference it’s being taken by the owners of the app.  And even thought they “do not have control over this” (which is what they try to sell us) they do not do anything about it, like give you a credit for the extra charges. I think this is not fair. People like me, with a condition and two little kids on my own can not go shopping by myself in this times and decide to pay to be done. Owners or creators of this app are selling the wrong message. Do not pay their membership. I can assure you it is not worthy. And on top of that they do not care about your situation or condition but the profit they are making at people’s expense. And by the way it is important to let you know that they DO NOT REFUND the membership  and after you  report an issue they disable the issue report at your account.

Items I ordered and had paid for were missing. (I was not contacted during the shopping process for notification that those items were out of stock and asked if I wanted a replacement or refund. This wasn’t the issue.) These items apparently were just missed during the shopping process.  Luckily, I noticed those items were missing and checked my receipt and saw that I was charged for them. I went to their website and clicked on the missing items, as prompted.  My ONLY options then were to receive a credit or get a refund. NO option to request that the remaining items on my order be completed and delivered.  I finally found a phone number that I called and got customer service people in South Africa who offered a host of excuse, but obviously can’t resolve errors made by Instacart.  All I wanted, was for them to fix THEIR error, request that my shopping order be completed and delivered.  They claimed they can’t do that.  I would have to place another $35 minimum order, if I wanted to get the missing items from my last order.  Although the error was theirs, they claimed they can’t waive the $35 minimum order, to provide a way of getting and delivering the rest of the items they had missed on my order. My complaint is not with the shopper, who most likely just overlooked some items. It’s with the company who doesn’t rectify errors.  I’m sure this happens on occasion, yet they have no solution in place to accommodate their customers when Instacart doesn’t process an order correctly. I’ve never encountered a company that wasn’t willing, nor have a process in place, to fix an error on their part and try to provide good service to their customers.  Although we’re still in a Pandemic, I’ll not use their services again because of their lack of accountability to their customers.  Mistakes happen; but having no way to fix the mistake is unacceptable.  It’s very disappointing, as it could be a good service, except they don’t stand behind their service."

Especially, during this pandemic and I have not seen them wear gloves or masks. I’m a personal shopper so I interact with them all day. I deliver groceries to customers cars and I’ve watched instacart shoppers drop things on the road or ground and just pick them back up. The worse one was when a lady dropped a whole carton of croissants and put them all back into the carton... in the middle of the parking lot. Or another instance with croissants where they ate one and closed it back up. DURING A PANDEMIC!! I get numerous phone calls a day with unhappy customers complaining about their instacart orders and it really gives us a bad name. It’s truly a great concept and some of the shoppers seem like wonderful people but allowing random people to just touch your groceries? There should be some kind of way to monitor all that goes on."

The shopper not only stole our items, but the company suspended my account due to a false accusation of aggressive behavior towards shopper. Mind you, we never receieved the items and the shopper accused us of being aggressive. In addition, we never received a refund for the items since they suspended our account. We called customer service and they couldn't access our account because it was blocked due to the complaint. I would not ever trust this service again. Not only does this shopper have our grocery items and we lost money, but now they have our home address and we do not feel safe. If this person stole from us, does this mean that Instacard does not even do background checks on who they hire? We trusted Instacart with our groceries and they matched us with a shopper who not only stole our groceries, but now has our home address and our information. I am extremely dissapointed on how this situation is being handled. First one of their shoppers steals our items, questioning the safety of Instacart; specifically my home address and financial information. In addition, they place the blame on the customer who has been loyal for months with no grounds and then suspend our account. I hope they realize that their shopper was a fraud and on top of that Instacart proceeds to instead of helping the victim, you assist the thief. What would Instacart do in a situation of an emergency? What if items were in extreme neccesity? I want to remind you that their shopper started shopping on April 2020, we have been loyal longer than that.Also want to note that I sent them pictures of the chat where I was desperately asking for my items just to be ignored and secondly, the map of the person ""dropping off"" items in a completely different city."

I got uneasy after that interaction and after she threw the first few bags at the door and decided I’d video her delivery. She also intentionally whacked my car with a bag of my groceries. I’ve submitted video of her doing so along with photos of all my damaged goods. *I posted this because Instacart customer service is of course making me jump through hoops to get a refund on the damaged goods. I know this shopper doesn’t represent the entire company, but their customer service gave me the feeling they didn’t really care.After spending a lot of time documenting and submitting photos and videos, I received an unenthusiastic apology and a partial refund. #instacart"

No response.I called Instacart to file a complaint. The resolution so far is to issue a $20 credit for over $23 of missing items. They may or may not investigate the shopper to see what happened. One representative went as far as to say that my items weren't stolen. But didn't have an answer as to where my food could be. Maybe they were never purchased.

Instacart delivers three bottles of Ken's Lite BALSAMIC Vinaigrette salad dressing plus lower quality paper towels and napkins!  Evidently, in 2020, Instacart's on-line inventory control system is worse than it was in a corner grocer in the 20th Century, and of course, there is no difference at all between balsamic and raspberry pomegranate dressing.  I guess I should consider myself lucky: If I had ordered chicken wings, I might have received chicken thighs."

Goods arrived within 2 hours and everything was in order until I noticed the Costco receipt attached show $122 before tax for all 14 items. $29 difference. When I enquired, Instacart customer rep said it was mark up charged by Costco. Really? Price was on Instacart app and if Instacart shopper paid $127 including sales tax, this means Instacart took margin of $29 on top of $24 for delivery, service and tipping. I understand that Instacart needs to make money but not $53 surcharges on $122 grocery in this time of Covid Pandemic.  When I pressed the issue, service rep kept on telling me that I don’t understand the concept but at the end advised me that to “appease” the situation, he or she will give me $20 credit for next Instacart purchase.

At checkout the company card (we use to pay for the customer purchases) declines when everything was correct on the order, and I have to pry chat support to get them to cancel, only to get an automated system not telling me how to fix the decline, but the company asking me if I can pay for it with my own money. I refused, and now am lost completely in how to continue with this company that does not train its employees. I was ""self trained"" by the faq's on their app, After reading these reviews from the customers, I can say its not just the suspected ""shopper stole them"" but also could be declines on the company card due to price inconsistencies, as well as giving incorrect adresses to the shopper, primarily wrong zip code. To note, I did not recieve any of the customers cash during this order after cancelling, so i'm unsure if most shoppers are actually pocketing groceries/money but from what I know now, Instacart steals from its customers by not returning their money back and also overcharging. As an employee there was no way to reach support either for any app issues or payment issues. Both shopper and customer are left it the dark in what's actually happening in these situations. I now don't want to continue for a company that doesn't refund the money to the customers. On the flip side the company even asks us to pay for the items ourselves if we experience company card issues, and I have heard mutiple reports of employees not being reimbursed as promised. Same just like the customer. I don't feel comfortable working for them anymore knowing so much can go wrong easily to make me look like a fake. We don't get paid enough for shopping, $7 base and own gas, so who knows what all shoppers are doing in actuality, but half of us are really trying to get the orders done and being failed by inconsistencies in the app. Blame it on the company pretty much!

For example, I asked for butter and was given buttermilk, and it said they found avocados but there were no avocados on my receipt, as well as other issues.  I could live with this, except that my receipt was for $85.74, and before delivery and service fees they said my total order was $119.  I immediately submitted an issue, and even though I followed up several times I never heard back. I had to search on Google for a phone number to call, which I did today. While I reached someone who was trying to help, ultimately I was told that $22 of the additional cost was because of markups with retailers. Even if this is the case, I was still owed the difference between the total actual cost plus markup and the amount they charged me ($119-$107).  When I asked about that difference, she didn’t seem to understand what I was saying and kept repeating the same thing over again.

I thought everything was going pretty good, occasional bad shopper but overall great service etc.  I was telling everyone about how great it was to be able to keep working (I work from home) and have someone else do all of my shopping.  Then, one day, I started comparing the prices of what I ordered vs. what the final bill was.  I understand (sort of) of price mark up on items.  They are a business trying to make money.  Stores do that themselves.  I get that.  Buy from one company, raise your prices, sell to someone else.  But when you get a receipt and it says $12.99 but you're charged $16.99, that's so not cool.  I have since learned that InstaCart has a rule that the shopper is not allowed to even give you the receipt.  I've specifically requested the receipts but very rarely get them.  This is why.  Every single time I get a receipt it is way less than what I have paid InstaCart.  They need to just be upfront and say they will charge an upgrade percentage on all items.  So if something says $6.99, they will charge, say, $7.69.  Be up front!!  Don't rip people off behind their backs.  That doesn't instill trust.  Right on your front page make it known that your prices are 10% higher (or whatever) than the stores price.  People will understand it is the price of convenience.  But don't tell them a price on something and then charge a higher price when you charge their credit card.I realize they've been in business for over 7 years or so.  But more and more people are experiencing their ripping people off tendencies as well as their horrid customer service where everything is someone else's fault not theirs at all.  Once this whole COVID-19 thing is over, I wonder how many people will actually linger on as customers.  They really need to change their practices and stop trying to rip their customers off if they want to stay in business and not get sued.But, the biggest, and most disturbing thing that has happened is discovering that they are charging way too much tax.  I recently was charged 75% tax on an order!  Customer Service claimed that there were items on the order that were taxable besides the one that actually was.  Everything else on my order was food!  I actually happened to have the receipt for that order and everything was marked F with only that one item marked Tx.  Calling Customer Service (Chat actually) is a joke.  They have canned answers that push the blame onto something else.  It's always something about prices being different or cities have different taxes and they charge the tax rate based on that city, etc.  So I push back, hard, and they finally admit that I'm right.  By the time I'm finished with them I've spent an hour trying to get it straightened out and the final resolution is a $5.00 credit.  Not what I was actually overcharged and not the hour's worth of my time.  But I pursued it out of principle.  The sad part is that they absolutely will not help you or admit fault unless you push back, hard.I'm getting very very tired of every order adding up wrong or having too much tax.  The California State Board of Equalization would frown heavily on this if they were made aware that InstaCart is charging more tax than on what is actually taxable!

https://ca.trustpilot.com/reviews/5ebc196025e5d209b8e9ddef,Abby Bart,1 star: Bad,Huge markups,"My shoppers were sometimes uncommunicative, but never really did anything wrong. My problem is with the Instacart service. My groceries were delivered this morning and the shopper happened to drop off the paper receipt. I was shocked that it was for $45 less than the subtotal I was charged by Instacart (before tip and service fees). This was on about $200 of groceries, so almost a 25% discrepancy. I reached out to Instacart customer service and after some back and forth, they finally told me that they include a markup on all items from most grocery stores. Each store has a policy, but it’s buried in the app - I think this information should be very, VERY upfront. I’m now cringing at all the times I’ve overspent on groceries without realizing it. Instacart has lost my patronage forever, this is disgusting and slimy."
https://ca.trustpilot.com/reviews/5ebc13cb25e5d20a88949047,Amy Ikerd,1 star: Bad,Never again . . .,"I decided to give Instacart a try and, unfortunately, it's been nothing but a major headache.  April 29th I ordered - only 10 things, no biggie.  Wasn't asking for toilet paper or any items that would likely be out of stock.  I had tipped $10, too, because I was just grateful to not have to go to the store.The shopper sent me alerts through the app saying that were out of this or that, but never really communicated.  So Target is COMPLETELY out of any gallon size zip lock storage bags?  Seems unlikely, but okay.  Next thing you know, I got an alert with a picture of my groceries on someone else's porch!  And once your items have been delivered the chat is disabled.  I immediately filed a report saying that my groceries were delivered to an unknown address.  Honestly, I would have been okay with the shopper going back to get them, and then bringing them to the correct address.  No such luck.I decided to track down a phone number and call.  You immediately get a response saying that the call volume is heavier than normal, and to expect long waits.  Imagine my surprise when someone answered within 2 minutes.  Firstly, it was a bit difficult to understand the customer service rep as English was not her first language, but whatever.  My problem was that she immediately tried to blame the issue on Target and suggested that I call them!  I challenged her and said that Target is merely a third party in this.  The problem is with INSTACART, not Target.  She backed down and said she would look into in further.Fifteen minutes later, and having been taken off and put back on hold no less than 10 times, Diana (customer service rep) said that I would have a refund within 5-10 business days.  Fair enough.That brings us to today (May 13).  It's been two weeks, and that refund is still not in my bank account.  The app says that I've been refunded, but the funds have not arrived.  So, again, I call Instacart.  I get the same message about heavy call volume blah blah blah, and yet, someone picks up almost immediately.  I explained to this customer service rep the situation, and he immediately tried to punt the ball and say it was an issue with my bank.  Again, I challenged that, and he relented and said he would look into it.  He came back after a few minutes and said that he was escalating my case and that I should have my refund today or tomorrow.What's interesting about this is that I figured out where my groceries were delivered.  The porch did not look like any of my neighbors, so that wasn't it.  There is a street name in my city that is similar to mine (Park vs. Parkview), though it is in an entirely different zip code.  I looked it up on Google maps and what do you know?!  Same porch that was in the pic the shopper sent to me.  I didn't drive over there to ask for my groceries, because it had been hours and who knows how long the refrigerated items had been sitting out.  But I almost feel like Instacart should reward me for solving the mystery for their incompetent shopper.It is worth noting that this company seems to have a pattern when a mistake is made . . . they love to deflect and punt the ball.  They state that call volumes are ""high"" yet someone answers almost immediately.  And no matter what the issue is, it's someone else's fault.  Ultimately, they just want you to go away and not bother them.  Now fingers crossed that my refund will actually land in my bank account by tomorrow."

When I contacted Instacart, the first service representative immediately, before I even finished my first sentence explaining the situation, yelled in a very loud voice, ""There are no dog treats on your receipt! I WAS going to give you a refund, but not NOW!"" I hadn't given her any order information and as the conversation continued it seemed like she wasn't looking at my receipt at all. The situation escalated from there as she rattled off a host of weird excuses, including saying that I was seeing someone else's receipt ""mixed in"" with mine. I asked her how that was possible and she screamed, ""NO! NO DOG TREATS! NOT YOURS!"" so loud that I started hearing buzzing and her audio started intermittently cutting out, at which point I said I couldn't hear her, she started yelling again (which I couldn't make out) so I hung up and tried again. The second service rep noticed two items (vegetables) on his copy of the receipt which were not on mine; instead, there were two dog treats. I got neither the vegetables I was supposed to get nor the dog treats I was charged for. He kept saying his receipt didn't have dog treats so I wasn't charged for them, but I definitely was, and he absolutely refused to acknowledge what happened. He also started offering weird excuses, saying I ""wasn't supposed to get a paper receipt"" (I didn't get one, I have no idea what he's talking about) and also that ""one tomato is only $1.64,"" which didn't seem to have any bearing on the matter. It felt very much like they were instructed to say a whole bunch of confusing stuff just to get people to give up and not try to get the situation resolved. Well, it worked, because I won't be shopping Instacart either on their website or through Dillon's anymore. Dillon's was very helpful when I called them about what happened, but if they insist on using Instacart, I can't trust them. I very much recommend avoiding Instacart if at all possible. UPDATE: I received both a voice mail and an email from Instacart with an apology and a promise for $100 credit on their website for my trouble, but the credit never showed up, of course.

The first couple times it happened I was refunded quickly. Suddenly I had to send pictures to prove what prices I saw on my meat package. Are there no honest companies out there?

Customer support's response was, ""Retailers set the prices of items available for delivery on the Instacart platform."" Therefore, I have a huge hold, paid a service fee, a tip for the driver, and apparently hidden markups. Do NOT use unless you must to shelter in place."

So I’m thinking everything is still smooth... until I get a call from my parents 10 minutes after receiving the final “your groceries have been delivered...” and asking for a tip. My mother tells me they hadn’t received anything. So she has my father go all the way downstairs to check. (I’m at work, unable to just drop everything and go myself.) As soon as the elevator doors open on the first floor, all he sees is a case of water and a couple of Arizona iced teas on the floor. Everyone in the building of the senior lifts had thought it was free food and took all their groceries leaving the heavier items. And my parents aren’t able to walk without assistance. I was livid!!! I’m a healthcare busy at the hospital and I’ve been singing praises of people who still go out and put themselves in harms way to deliver groceries on the same level. But this experience just made me so incredibly mad because I already have no help in caring for my parents. It’s already hard enough for me to do everything on top of working and school.

There is NO number to call and talk to anyone so you are stuck trying to send emails in hopes that someone will respond. I finally disputed the up-charge with my credit card company (I only disputed the extra funds that they charged me) and hopefully it will get resolved this way. Interestingly, within 2 days of my dispute, Instacart sent me an email saying that they were 'blocking me from future use' due to the dispute I filed. What a TERRIBLE UNETHICAL company to try to work with. Just the fact that they have time to send out a letter like that but dont have time to look into my complaint of being overcharged is irresponsible. They want to give you a credit for future purchases instead of refunding your money. That is BS. AND - the credit they offered me in a chat for future use was not even the total amount of money I lost. Because of this experience, I dont think I will ever in my life order groceries from ANYWHERE as I feel I am not in control of my credit card - they literally can charge anything they want and then it is up to you to waste 8 - 12 hours trying to get your money back.

You can do all kinds of things via app including real time contacting of a person who is doing the shopping, but to contest an item on the bill you have to call and talk and look through the receipt etc..

Two of the items they did not have so the shopper without notifying me chose a replacement for me on his own. They were totally different. Both that I ordered were vegetables and gluten free and the shopper on his own replaced them with chicken and flour. Not only am I a vegetarian so I would not eat the chicken but I have celiac and what he chose for me without my approval and on my credit card is something that would put me in the hospital right away. That is the 2nd time a shopper purchased non gluten free items for a gluten free customer with celiac and making the decision on their own. that is a health hazard on their part!!

However, it is not always clear how much will get charged to your account and - more importantly - they will place a hold on your money even if an order wasn't actually placed.Just last week, I tried to place an order (around $120 in item costs) and had a $175 charge appear on my bank statement though *no order was actually placed*; I didn't receive any items and there was no record that I had been charged, except through my bank.  Fortunately, I had enough to cover the charge, but I can imagine many situations where this would cause an overdraft.  It took 6 days for this amount to be refunded to my account.(5) Customer service is terrible, basically nonexistentEvery time I have tried to contact customer service (except last week), I have just given up instead, because it is such a frustrating process.  While the rest of their website is gorgeous and well put together, the customer service parts seem like they were built in the early 90s - completely laughable.  The easiest way to get in touch seems to be through the barely functional chat box, though it still took me close to 2 hours last week to get an answer about why my account had been charged without an order.  The first time I got connected to an agent on the chat, they took so long between responses that the chat timed out and I had to restart the process.  I would never have imagined it would take 2 hours to have someone tell me 'Yeah, we don't know if there is an order or when the charge will be removed - probably around a week'.  It's like their system is built to be frustrating, to keep people from reaching out or asking questions.In general, it just seems like Instacart does not care about us as customers or as workers/shoppers - they only care about getting your coins and once they have them, everything else is up in the air.  Avoid this service unless you don't care how, when, or *if* you get the groceries you paid for."

He showed up in the lobby of my building, where my landlord was standing, wearing no mask or facial covering, disallowing him entrance--- $300. fine in this state for not wearing mask, BTW.So I had to meet him at a side door, exiting my apartment, walking up stairs ( I'm disabled) wearing a mask myself, and gloves ( high risk), opened door for this 22 year old irresponsible 12 year old, and he was holding plastic bags (  and on which COVID 19 can survive for 3 days) placed the bags on ground, which were exceptionally heavy for me to lift, but wanted no contact, which was the ENTIRE PURPOSE OF ORDERING FROM INSTACART. he told me ""I forgot my mask"".5. Brought everything in, disinfected packing, realized it was worse than my having gone to a ""Vulnerable"" early hour shopping time, that he wasn't wearing gloves either, that he could easily be a carrier who was asymptomatic,  that the bags weren't even from the Grocery Store I'd specified--- no wonder he was making so many substitutes, wrong market!  Then heard Gov Cuomo on his broadcast actually state"" If you don't wear a mask, YOU COULD KILL SOMEONE SO JUST WEAR ONE"".6.I've heard there's a national shortage of Valium. INSTACART would be one reason why... 7. I threw out the groceries....after deliberating that his hands were all over everything  even after disinfecting The stakes are too high, as an asthmatic & with a close friend also medically vulnerable, not elderly, dying of COVID 19 last month...And gingerly handled the plastic bags as I disposed of them, realizing this irresponsible worker had taken risks with MY LIFE. I spent an HOUR on hold trying to reach someone in charge at INSTACART.They outsource all calls to some foreign country where nobody understood anything I was  saying. JUST DON'T ORDER FROM THEM IF YOU ARE MEDICALLY FRAGILE. INSTACART DOESN'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING OR ANYONE."

I chatted with support and they said because there was no way to prove I was supposed to get free delivery they could not remove the charge. And then they charged my card an additional $10 in case I wanted to order more things. What? And I have to wait 3-5 business days to get that back. BUT if I wanted to save delivery fees I could pay $99 for a year worth of free delivery. Um that’s a hard no from me. This was a one time use for me!

As I am 68 and have lung disease, I could not risk going shopping myself.  I am a Costco member for 35 years and figured if they went with Instacart instead of curbside assist, that they had checked out the company.  Don't get me wrong, my shopper was excellent and no contact occurred and she communicated with me about anything she couldn't fill was to my house before frozen stuff wasn't any more.  But my order which was exactly the same as my last time physically shopping there, was almost twice what it would cost if I went myself.  Perfect example, two pork loins, 5 lbs total, marked clearly 2.99 a pound, $15.91, I was charged 7.99 a pound or $36.95 more than twice the cost, everything was really marked up, more than 25%, then there was the delivery fee and service fees of 8.50 fee if I remember 7.50.  Plus since it wasn't the shoppers fault the company screwed me, I still tipped her.  By all this my order cost more than twice what the actual cost would have been.  If some of that had been going to the shopper I wouldn't have felt so taken advantage of, she risked herself and I could never afford to tip enough for something like that, but I'm told the shoppers get a flat rate around minimum wage...   I called Instacart, was on hold more than two hours then auto disconnected.  Emailed on help@instacart, automated response that would forward to complaint department, never heard anything, tried to report to Costco, but they're still overwhelmed.  A month later, still nothing.  Thank goodness for Walmart curbside pick up.  They've been great and I just sit in my truck and they load it into my cooler in the bed.  I have steered all my elderly neighbors to Walmart curbside and warned everyone off Instacart."

During this pandemic they've raised their Delivery Charge from $5.99 to $8.99, have an additional Service Fee added on, on my last order it was $4.45 but the worse add-on's were the additional fee on almost every item.  This does NOT include the tip for the shopper (which to be should be where the bulk of the fees should go!) Being a regular shopper at Costco I saw a few higher prices when ordering and thought simply that it was the warehouse shortage at this hard time, so naturally more costly.  Unfortunately, upon delivery I looked at the receipt and that was NOT the case.  Costco charged their normal prices only for Instacart to add their own fee to the items.  So sad that at this time when the country is hurting there are companies that are still greedy and thirsty to 'get rich' at any expense.  I will NOT be using instacart again and unless everyone does the research on this company, I would suggest if you need home delivery, check out another service or even better, find someone to do your shopping and give that person all the $$ since THEY not the companies are risking their lives to shop and deliver the groceries."

For example, from Costco, I ordered paper towels and the Costco store receipt was $20.99 for this item (that's what Instacart paid) but Instacart charged me $25.69.   The Costco store receipt total for all items I ordered was $198.10, but Instacart charged me $227.30, plus tax, a delivery fee, tip and a service fee.  I reported this up charge as a problem and I received an explanation from Instacart that tried to put the blame on Costco.  I am not buying Instacart's explanation  - the store receipt speaks for itself.  Apparently part of the cover up is to withhold the store receipt from customers so customers don't see how much of an up charge Instacart keeps.  So I am done with Instacart.

I don't know who gets to keep the overcharge, but with a $45 tip to the shopper and then the $31 overcharge, I would be smiling and happy when I dropped off the groceries too. It's a SCAM. I have to assume that the other two orders were the same scam and with the $100 express membership (that I cannot cancel) I am most likely out well over $200.00. Expensive lesson to learn. PLEASE LISTEN, DO NOT USE INSTACART - THEY WILL OVERCHARGE YOU!

Most customers know that prices are inflated on Instacart; however, please be aware that if you choose ""1 pound"" of oranges let's say, you could receive ONE orange, yet still be charged for a full pound. Also, the shopper can make random, cheaper replacements WITHOUT your approval, yet you're still charged for the original price (for instance, I ordered a full gallon of milk from a specific brand, yet ended up with half a gallon from a whole different brand. The shopper didn't even request approval to swap). PLEASE review your items and make sure you got exactly what you asked for (or the approved swaps).There's a lot of funky math and plain robbery going on at Instacart. I understand that these are chaotic times, but Instacart really needs to reevaluate its model. They also need to revamp their CX system and retrain their agents and shoppers.

Now, when I placed the order on 4/29/20 for delivery the next day, I was willing to swallow the cost PROVIDED they delivered what I had ordered, which the website said was available at wegmans. Lo and behold, I get texts from the shopper saying that MORE THAN HALF of everything I wanted was out of stock. Instacart is not letting anyone know on their website that they had no real time knowledge of inventory and that the stores were not putting aside anything for them/giving them priority. THIS SHOULD BE CLEARLY WORDED, so that we don’t waste time shopping online and have an “unrealistic” expectation of having all our grocery items delivered at the pre-arranged date & time! I needed a lot of the items to cook dinner for my family! Amazon, Target & Walmart would be in so much trouble if their website said something was in stock, charged your credit card, promised delivery of it and then text/email you to tell you it was unavailable and asks if you want a replacement/substitute. And they don’t even charge all these fees and try to sell you things at a higher price as compared to in store. All I can say is, if you have money to burn and don’t mind replacing/substituting everything you took the time to order AND spending even more time with customer service, chat or otherwise, which incidentally (or perhaps intentionally) disconnected me THREE times while the shopper was waiting for instructions at wegmans, THIS SERVICE IS FOR YOU!!!!!I canceled the ongoing order because I was unwilling to pay all their fees for a few measly items, tried to still give tip to shopper but was not given any help on how to do this (Castiemme S, if you’re reading this, I’m sorry you did not get anything for your efforts) and am waiting to see if my $105 put on hold by instacart will be posted as charged or unsuspended from “pending” (in other words, truly canceled without any fees).

Good communication and good substitutions etc. The drivers I've dealt with have all been fantastic. That is not the problem. The problem is the COMPANY itself. One of my orders never arrived at all, yet I was charged. It was a 30 item order so pretty large, and the shopper refunded 29 of the items (either to not have to shop as much and keep the delivery fee and tip or because he really couldn't find 29 of the items...) but the point is nothing ever came, although the update came through that the delivery was complete. I've been home all the time as we all have and nobody showed up. So, I contacted Instacart's customer service and explained the situation. No reply. I sent reminders. No reply. I then disputed the charge with my cc company (small amount - less than $15 since it was just the one item that was ""delivered""). I've placed a few orders since the dispute and one arrived a few days ago - no issues at all. I had another order planned for today, but woke up this morning to a message in my email about my dispute and another email to say my pending order was canceled but no to worry, because I could ""re-order with one click"". I tried logging in and resetting my password but nothing worked. Then I tried logging in using my Apple ID to gain access to my account and then I received the message my account had been canceled. So, because I disputed a less than $15 charge with them for NON delivery (so we don't call it pure theft on their or their driver's behalf), they feel they should cancel my account? Unbelievably unprofessional and poor service. Hey IC, anybody can be a middle man and pay someone to shop for them. You App is pretty nice, but your company is a joke. I hope the drivers find other jobs for more respectable companies. I for one will never use IC ever again. Good riddance."

I started out trusting them fully and denying other drivers' truths! Sure, Instacart makes you think you're earning quite a bit. The reality is far from that. Not only do they pay you very little for certain batches and allow their customers to offer you $2 tips for retrieving 60+ items in one batch (throughout COVID-19) but during their promos (Complete 4 batches $50 guaranteed, etc), 9 times out of 10 you're going to experience some sort of issue with the app. I've never had any issues with the app until today. The promo I mentioned above was offered, and like any other day I began my batches. With the first issue, the app crashed. It froze while I was on an active order and it has NEVER froze before. Not to fret because I still made the delivery happen! I've never taken the opportunity to work on a promo day, so I didn't believe all of the other reviews I was reading because I've had such a great experience thus far. The second issue- my notifications are constant throughout the day and often get overwhelming, but that just let's me know I'm getting my fair share of batches. However, today my available batches has stalled at ""no available batches"" for longer than it has any day I've used instacart. I usually refresh a few times or close the app and my available batches reappear. Not today! What a scam Instacart. This is the first time your company has been profitable and you are failing miserably at being able to keep up. I don't know if instacart has had its first lawsuit, but it if not, it isn't far behind. It sucks that companies like these take advantage of their drivers. Drivers all across the Globe often get horrible pay and treatment, but instacart couldn't decide to be different? The horror stories I've heard are true."

Due to my busy lifestyle and work schedule i was excited to find an app that i could have groceries delivered to my doorstep while i complete task at hand that i cannot do or having trouble finding time to do. My first impression was non satisfying. Three of my most important items were not delivered. My loaf of bread from the middle back was COMPLETELY smashed. I had someone else’s item as well. The time it took me to go out later that evening to get my items and getting on the app to figure out how to talk to someone about my issues was impossible and a huge waste of my time. No one reached out to me for the mistakes or even offered to have my missing items delivered to me. Instead i was just given a credit on my next order and the only reason i found that credit was because i was searching for a way to speak to someone. I had spoken by chat to someone before i had made the decision to give it a try (and have it saved) that the answer to my question said “Tip” did not mean an actually “Tip” to the shopper. It was a service charge in the “service fee” but the person i spoke with today (by the way, i had to get the number from my bank to call and speak with a representative, because no number or email to speak with anyone is listed in the settings.) told me today that the shopper was given a tip listed on the receipt. So the shopper got a $6.00 tip + the $5.00 tip i gave her. Horrible experience, waste of time, untrained shopper, and a lot of aggravation!  Would not recommend this service to anyone!"

Their total was $36.34, which is about $6.80 more for the 6 items I bought.    Then they added 17.01 in service fees, delivery, and tips.   Plus an additional $3.35 in tax even though the items had already been taxed at Costco.  In the end I paid $55.71 for 29.54 worth of groceries.   Of course i understand they should make money for shopping and delivering but they are gouging the public.

Instacart and their shoppers are bombarded with orders. I used to do my own grocery shopping and then I sustained an ankle injury and am temporarily not able to walk without crutches. My issue comes with the delivery time promises. The scheduled delivery of my order was on a Thursday and it kept on being postponed several times that day. I have asked someone to help me put groceries away that day and the groceries never came. Instacart won't allow me to increase the tip as I have heard that tips are how they entice their shoppers do grocery orders and now they can cherry pick which grocery orders are more lucrative. So instacart compensates below legal cost of hourly pay and rely on their customers to provide a majority of the shoppers income. Quite unethical. Anyway, Sunday came and again, I receive a message that the delivery will be delayed... but good news... *it's expected to come today*... it didn't come, and no message thereafter, no updates or reschedule or even a cancellation, nothing. This is after chatting with customer representaives who don't complete the chat and answer or reply once then no replies after, so I'm not sure if they are AI. I finally got the option to speak to an agent and got my Instacart subscription and deliveries cancelled. The representative was apologetic and even notioned that it's a terrible company in her own ""discreet and not so discreet manner"" Unethical company, terrible service and communication... I ended up shopping local and provided a monetary donation to the volunteer legion workers who are doing deliveries for the community. Lesson learned."

Normally, I purchase organic food. The organic chicken and turkey I had requested was substituted for conventional, however they only increased the quantity purchased but did not change the type of meat purchased. Specifically, they charged me for 4.8 lbs of organic chicken tight at the organic price of 5.49 instead of the non organic price of 2.19 which i could see on the packaging of the conventional chicken thighs i received. Instead of charging me $16.45 which was the sticker price on the chicken, they charged me $41.23. The exact same thing happened to the turkey. Understanding mistakes happen, i reported the issue through the app, waited a few days and no response. Then i tried to call Instacart and they were not taking any calls. I then proceeded to email them and again no response. Eventually i contested the fee with bank and they quickly resolved the dispute since i had overwhelming evidence of the mistake. I then receive an email from instacart that my account is blocked because i contested the incorrect charge. I once again nicely responded and explained the situation and have not heard back from them.Companies like this disgust me. They could have easily owned up to their mistake and issued a refund. Except they hoped that i would forget and then penalized me for taking extraordinary measures to correct their fraud.Imagine how many households that don't necessarily look at the final receipt are scammed each and every day. Especially in today's environment when our parents and grandparents may be relying on companies like instacart to get basic supplies, we must ensure that companies act ethically.Has anyone had a similar experience with instacart?

They charged me twice and sometimes 3 times for things that I only have 1 of.  For example I was charged for 3 bags of cat food, I have one and the actual store receipt plainly states that.  This seems pretty cut and dry, but two weeks later no one from Instacart has reached out to me to resolve this.  I have reached out to friends and neighbors and apparently many people  I know have had the same experience.  Instacart is evidently taking advantage of families during a time of crisis.  I urge everyone who has had a negative experience with this thieving company to file a complaint with the Attorney General, the Better Business Bureau and their Governor.

My Instacart subtotal today was $30 more than the actual Costco subtotal. I knew I wouldn't be able to contact  IC customer service because there is none so I Googled it. Sure enough IC raises the price of each item anywhere from 8-15% per item.

Example:  item #7104060509 POLLY-O STRING CHEESE.  BJs price in store as per BJs store receipt was $9.39. INSTACART CHARGED me $11.69.  That’s the same scenario for each and every item purchased for me at BJs by Instacart.  I had 23 items.  My bill with INSTACART was substantially higher (for the groceries only) than the BJs receipt!  Upwards of $50. In addition to the $50 difference, you are charged a “delivery fee” of $8.99 which I could understand; PLUS a “SERVICE FEE” of $10.15????? So that’s now $19.14.    Of course there’s a tip percentage added at your discretion which should be.  These delivery people are the ones doing the work.  I feel the adding on of a percentage on each product is despicable.

I have been trying to contact the person who delivered from food emporium since a long time. First of all they didn’t get the proper order and second of all they delivered 3 things worth 14$ and charged 35$ + $15 + $5 for delivery!!!Am I crazy that I’ll pay $55 for delivery for a $14 bill!????Really really bad service.And no one answers the phone or answers the complaint. Will never order on this stupid app. This is really bad service.I would have cancelled the order if barely anything was available!!!!I messed so many times that of it’s not available please replace with this or that. The mint that was replaced has only barely one leaf and it’s for $4.Just because the situation is bad doesn’t mean that you will send any crap and charge anything from the customer! The service of yours sucks!!!! I will do higher complaints. For a bill of 218$ you charge $312. Am I crazy that they pay almost $100 for delivery????? This is really bad and disgusting!!!!My bill for Costco was $218.25 including tax. (I have attached a copy of the bill)And food emporium is $25.46 the pdf you just sent me. (As I did not get the bill with my order)So total is $243.71.And I was charged $316.14 (I have attached that also on this mail.So why a charge of almost $60 for delivery??????When I didn’t even get the stuff properly.I ordered cauliflower and you sent me cauliflower chips! I ordered peas and you sent pea chips.This is not ethical!!I didn’t get the stuff I ordered from food emporium and neither I got the refund for the kettle chips and cilantro. I have attached all the pictures!The service sucks. At this time also all they can think of is earning money from customers!!

I've gotten no where. I was charged $249.99, but it should have been more like $210. I understand they upcharge a certain amount on each item, have a service fee, and a delivery fee, but I got items in smaller quantities, sizes, etc., and was literally double charged on multiple items. I did not get what I ordered. I don't want to shortchange the delivery person, and I don't think he should be punished by me taking away his tip...but I don't know how to get a refund.

https://ca.trustpilot.com/reviews/5ea19c1e086b6409bc8bb120,Justine Travnicek,1 star: Bad,Horrible service for many reasons,"Horrible service for many reasons. ***Check your order! They overcharge and will not refund***1. The website offered replacement items that cost more than the item ordered, which is fine, but when I received the cheaper original item in my order I was still charged for the pricey replacement item. The receipt that came with my groceries was $204 including tax, the charge (for only groceries) was $245 including the tax online and on my credit card.2. The website would give one price but at the checkout it would be another. For an example, Meat Pies were 1.66 online, the receipt shows that they are .99, I was charged for the online price. I ordered two sweet potatoes which came to $2.81, the website charged me $10.98. 3. When I contacted Instacart about this, they only addressed the sweet potato weight difference and offered a credit to my account of $20. I was not happy with that solution as it did not match the overcharge that was taken from my credit card. 4. Rocio then said he would send me a refund. 'We really sorry for this inconvenience I refunded to your account the difference overcharged than you ordered.It take 5-10 days to process depend of your bank.Regards,RocioInstacart CareI only received $11.89 refunded on my credit card. Needless to say, I will never use this service again. I question how often these overcharges happen in their favour without people noticing or having the time to sort it out. BBB has a long list of complaints about this service, today another one. If they just refunded me the overcharge to begin with, they would have kept a customer, the customer's friends and  family would have heard great reviews instead of a warning about the company, and the public would have one less bad review to read and share on social media."

I tried emails, chats, etc (all with desperate pleas to refund my order) with no answer. Finally, after over a month and I get someone to respond on their chat on the website. They tell me that since it's been more than 15 days since my order was placed, they can only offer store credit. I tell them but that's not fair because I tried reaching out earlier, and had someone responded to customer service emails it would've been way less than 15 days. They tell me there's nothing they can do. I definitely didn't want to accept store credit, I mean why would I ever use instacart again after this?

I specifically put to deliver to the blue doors and not the side door as our renter lives there and may think someone bought the groceries for him. It's not that he would steal them, it's that he may think someone ordered it for him and he'd take it. Only TWICE were the instructions followed.Then they charge you for the groceries but they're not included. One dumb shopper took a picture of what she delivered PROVING that she did not deliver all of the items, yet i was charged for them. My pre-authorization charge for one shopping was returned and correctly charged to the right amount. The other three are still there and they're saying, as I type this, that my bank will remove 24-48 hours. BS. The bank always removes it the same day and charges it correctly the same day BASED on what they are charging. This was the only time a pre-authorization charge remained and the amount that should be charged not charged. I understand pre-authorization charges can take time with some companies but that doesn't happen with THIS company.Out of 8 orders, 4 of them were fine, other 4 were terrible. How do you get it wrong 50% of the time? And I believe if I keep using them, the amount of screw ups from the dumb shoppers they have will increase. I am searching for another grocery delivery company that has the same choices as Instacart does. If Walmart didn't have half their crap as in store only, I'd dump this horrible company in a heartbeat.  I HATE this company. But they have a wide variety of stores to choose from so I'm stuck with this. I don't want to pay a yearly membership for BJs and Costco and I don't purchase all of the items there anyways.  If your area has more than 1 grocery store delivery options where both have a variety of stores to shop from AVOID INSTACART AT ALL COST."

I walked around my complex to see if my order was at a neighbor’s door but no luck. I tried to call Instacart but the message says they do not have phone service right now but to go to website. I went to website and sent two emails but never got a response. My credit card company will not give me a credit because they need to be contacted by the company confirming I am entitled to a refund. They have the nerve to be sending me emails about their services, but guess what? They are no reply emails! This company is still doing business and if you get your order you are none the wiser that if there is a problem you will never be able to contact them. I looked up the company that does business under the name of Instacart they are I in San Francisco,  it when I tried to call them their automatic voicemail box was full. That about sums up this company. UPDATE: I finally got through to Instacart when they started answering their phones again. Talked to Louis, he found my email advising I had not received my order and said he would fill out a work order. Later that day I received an email from Instacart advising they were issuing me a full refund! Had to update my review with that information. I think I will give Instacart another chance."

In the first delivery, tge wrong items were delivered. When the shopper was told that it was wrong,  she insisted that was the order.

Jennifer, the shopper, called me and left a message because I was not available insisting that I call her back.

I alerted instacart of the situation via their channel to report a concern. I received a generic email about the situation.  When Jennifer showed up with the day late order to MY AGING RELATIVES HOME, she was insistant about a tip. My grandmother called me and was totally confused about what was going on so she gave Jennifer the phone.  Jennifer was insistent that I forgot or didn't know how to leave her a tip on the app and wanted to walk me through the process.  There was a back and forth exchange THAT WAS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!!!!

I am currently in an apartment with a 98 year old woman recovering from recent heart and hip surgery. I joined instacart in order to arrange for the delivery of food because neither of us is ambulatory. Instacart offered a 2 week free trial. My experience during the free trial was adequate - if expensive.  But each time I attempted to talk to an instacart representative to address an issue or error, it became increasingly difficult. Over the next week during the current pandemic it became very difficult to get a delivery slot in my elected stores. On the 4th of the month, at about 3 a.m., I was able to secure a delivery slot and filled my shopping basket. Delivery was scheduled for 6 days later. On the promised date of delivery, my shopper was in the store towards closing hour but then was put out as closing hour past, and my order was canceled. Despite many repeated efforts I was unable to reach anyone at instacart. They seem to have disabled the features in their application that permitted one to schedule a call back. The application feature that supposedly enables one to report a problem with an order again did not work. I started fresh and at about 4 am was again able to obtain a new delivery spot for the subsequent week - then two weeks from the date of my first order. I started with my recently canceled the order and added additional items.  On the date of promised delivery, once again the assigned instacart shopper started late in the afternoon and after a half hour in the store, my order was again cancelled.  Once again I have been unable to reach Instacart to report the issue.  Instacart has taken my money but failed to do as promised or to be at all responsive.   I understand the stresses on them during the pandemic but to simply cancel my orders without any further communication, and to frustrate any effort at communication with them directly, is absolutely unacceptable. I would certainly recommend any other shopping service available to you at the time. It is not a matter of their not being worth the money, it is a matter of their being worthless - and of leaving me stranded without food and without communication.  If I could give them zero stars I would."

So, I sat on hold with Customer Service for more than an hour, they reassigned it and gave a $20 credit. Great. They guy who delivered then was great, except he smoked in the car and my grocery bags smelled like smoke. I'm highly allergic. So fast forward a few weeks, I decide to give it another go and use my $20 credit. I ordered from 2 stores - Central Market and Costco. Central Market totaled around $125 before fees, Costco was $13. I receive a notice through the app my Central Mrkt order was being shopped, in 5 or 10 min I get another notice it was complete. I thought WOW they were fast. I looked at the receipt and noticed there were a ton of adjustments that the shopper never asked me about, increasing my order total. Shortly after I got a notice my Costco order was being shopped by a different shopper. I then noticed my Central Market was allegedly delivered....problem is, it wasn't. I was home all day and nothing. I drove up & down my street checking neighboring houses - nothing. I asked my Costco shopper if she had it. She said no. I got my 2 items from Costco. After a rabbit trail through the app, I finally was able to mark all items in the CM order as missing. I tried to call - Instacart isn't taking calls - my guess is because they're hammered with customer complaints. Couldn't access chat at all. I emailed customer support multiple times. Never received an answer. Three days later I finally gave it another go and was able to get into the Chat queue. Spoke with someone, told him the story, he refunded the CM items, but failed to reapply my $20 credit to my Costco order and left it on the CM order that was being refunded, so the refund is short by $20 bucks.... or they've retained their fees for a service they never performed. Just today my neighbor also ordered from them and had very similar problems. I am done with this service and will be speaking with my bank once the bill for CM clears. Ironically, the day I was supposed to have received my order and didn't, I went to the store myself. Shopped the exact same items, added a few additional things and stuff for my neighbors.

So, we replaced it with less and cheaper items as there were not many options available per that person.  In the app, it showed less price due to refunds however in my card activity it shows that they charged me $180.00 on top of that it charged me $17.76 for the items we replaced.

The reason for this policy is because Instacart does not update the prices for the food on a weekly basis.The abuse is that even when the store receipt is lower, Instacart will maintain a fraud version of the mark-up price by ignoring the sale price.  On Mar. 1st, the Supervisor refused to adjust the order price (which in addition to the service fees) to collect enough mark-up (above the store receipt) to double the total of the store receipt.I refused to be abused by such blatant fraud by the Instacart Supervisor, a Mexican woman.  I rejected the order.

Again without even trying to contact me about the situation first. The customer service said there was nothing they could do, which obviously just isn't true. They said the only thing I could do would be to reorder and then wait ANOTHER week to get my delivery.

Again they were delivered to the wrong house, but this time the people were home and the delivery arrived on our doorstep.  We noticed one BIG problem. InstaCart lists the 'regular' prices for products but does NOT list sale prices or in-store specials.

She said ... get this ... they text through the app.  I DON'T HAVE THE APP!!  They never said on their site that I would need any app and, to tell you the truth, I still don't know if it's the Wegman's app (the store I ordered through) or InstaCart app.  She apologized and said she would refund the three items at issue. Even if she had just refunded the one and charged me the price for the items I had ordered on the others would have been acceptable, but she said (notice ""said"") she would refund all three, so I was very pleased.  She was very pleasant and said at the end that, for my troubles she was giving me a $10 credit to order on InstaCart again.  I told her that was not necessary and she said, don't worry, I'd like to.  I thanked her again several times.  Sound great, right?  It is now over a week and I have not received any of the refunded amounts or the credit that were promised.

I decided to try Instacart due to this.  They supposedly offer same day or next day service.  Well that did not happen.  There was a 4 - 5 day wait time.  I made it through with what I had and delivery food until I could get a delivery.  I was extremely happy with my shopper.  She did a great job communicating and doing her best to get me what I wanted or an equal.  I was even very happy with the fact that I was notified when she got to the store and left the store so I knew exactly when to expect delivery.  She left the receipt from the store in the bags, as I expected she would.  When I later logged onto the Instacart site I noticed that Instacart charged me $15.00 more for my groceries than the actual charge from the grocery store on the receipt.   Where did that $15.00 go?? That was on top of the $3.99 delivery fee, $3.46 service fee, $2.29 heavy order fee.  I expected the $3.99 fee but not the other 2 fees.  So basically I spent over $20.00 more than expected or feel I should have been charged. And still really interested in where the $15.00 went.  I contacted them only to find out that the prices that the store charges are NOT the prices that Instacart charges. WHAT A RIP OFF."

Mind you, I do have additional supermarkets in my area, but they were not listed. I went through a tedious process of adding approximately 30 items to my cart— all very overpriced, but I figured the convenience would be worth the cost and time to build the list. When I went to pay for the order— presto— “sorry, we don’t deliver to your area— please add another address.” REALLY?! What an annoying waste of time and disappointment the service is."

The grocery picker actually sent me the scan from the store on a 1.69 item that instacart charged me 1.99 for. The only mechanism to complain is about the picker who did a great job. Will never use instacart again. Plenty of other ways to accomplish grocery delivery without being ripped off.

Nor do they read carefully the specified item, or amount on the shopping list.  It's true these shoppers don't get paid enough but I sure tip generously, where one quarter of my bill was the tip.

However, the next day they charged me 56.98 which basically canceled my entitled refund. I disputed the charge with Amex. However, their customer service line does not take calls and good luck getting any kind of replies to an email. If instacart is not accessible then, according to Amex, I win the dispute. I encourage everyone to put false charges in dispute.2. Due to the above activity on my credit card, initiated by Instacart , they sent me an email saying there was suspicious activity on my credit card and deactivated my account. They are the ones who created the suspicious activity. At the same time my account was deactivated I received an email from them requesting photos of my drivers license and the last four digits of my credit card. They wanted me to authenticate my identity in order to reactivate my account. First of all who sends such sensitive documentation via email to anyone? Secondly, the email address to send such documentation was not valid.3. I really want my account activated because I need the 25 pound bags of cat food delivered to feed  ferals. For the cats I will put up with almost anything.  4. I called the customer service number to find out how to get my account reactivated. It’s inoperable. Try sending a message?

They claimed no shopper was available and that we would have to get another time slot and re-do the whole order on their app.  But no time slot was available!  Their customer service was not helpful at all.

Not only does instacart charge for the service, but they charge full price for all items even when the store does not charge the instacart shopper the full price. Instacart  pockets this difference too. I would rather that go to the actual shopper who is risking his/her life. Also when you build your grocery list, instart shows a discount, then charges full price. I think  it is deceptive to show a discount and then charge full price. My bill on instacart was for 178.18, actual charge at the grocery store was 156.82."

Does Instacart not vet their delivery shoppers?  The problem with the Instacart website is it asks you if any item is missing? Technically, I get my avocados BUT 3 ARE MISSING.  There is no place on the website to allow me to put down how many avocados are missing.  IT IS A SERVICE THAT IS TOO COSTLY. I WILL NEVER USE IT AGAIN.

The second time was 2 week ago at the beginning of the pandemic. The shopper went to Market Basket and did a good job. He substituted a couple of thing and left 2 things out that I got charged for, but I was mostly happy. I did get a refund for the missing items. The third time was yesterday and it was not good.I was chatting with the shopper and told her 5 times not to make substitutions. If it was not in stock, don’t buy anything, she said ok. I guess what she meant was FU! My order was crazy! I had $175.00 of things in the cart and almost all of them were wrong or missing. She left the actual receipt in one of the bags, it was for $99.00, but they were going to charge me the $175 until I made a complaint. I got food I can’t eat, because of food allergies and some produce that was moldy and rotten. I still have her a good tip, the shoppers are putting their health at risk to do this. But I don’t have money to throw away on rotten food. And the substitutions were bizarre! I got Eggo waffles because they were out of lasagna noodles.

While it is true that the demand for on-line food shopping has increased exponentially in response to the pandemic's home lockdown, Amazon has done a very good job of keeping up with delivery even though delivery can be delayed by a couple of days and some items in the ""cart"" become unavailable by the time a customer has a delivery time.   Amazon may initially report that there is no delivery available but if the customer checks back throughout the day, delivery openings  become available.  Amazon is reliable, it provides a real time tracking of your delivery,  lets you know when it will arrive and be delivered to your doorstep.   Instacart has no delivery times for days and days and days.   In fact, it has NO DELIVERY TIMES EVER!!  What makes this particularly egregious is that there is no information provided.     I've checked and checked and checked the Instacart website and get the same message ""NO DELIVERY TIMES"".     May I suggest two things:  hiring more help (goodness knows there are lots of people who could use the money) and creating a waiting list where one can see where one stands with regard to delivery?    In short, using Instacart is worthless.  I wasted hours of my time filling a virtual cart with items I will never get and wasted even more time checking this very poorly managed website.

The shopper was in the store for 4 hours!. She repeatedly would replace items not in stock or that she couldn't find with random products I did not ask for or approve. I had to message her several times to put the items back and not to just randomly replace items. She replaced my choice of 8 large avocados with 6 bags of 6 avocados, but when they were delivered there was only one bag of six even though I was charged for all 6 bags. $24! When she delivered the groceries many were stacked on my porch not even in bags, and I saw many of them had spilled  out in her trunk. Nothing was cold. Milk was warm, all frozen food was defrosted. I could not eat any of it. Some of the replacements were not correct or asked for/approved of. Her communication was seriously lacking. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with grocery delivery. Too much of the food had to be thrown out so a credit on my instacart account will not suffice. I will need a refund to my credit card for everything that was cold or frozen as it was all inedible. My breads were crushed under heavy cans, my chips were broken. This woman needs to be fired. I don't know what she was doing in the store for 4 hours as it was not a lot of groceries and the ALDI is a small store with only 5 aisles. I removed her tip from my order but was charged more than my order total by $5. Everything about this experience and order was a disaster.

Out of twenty items I ordered I was missing 11 items. Those items I did receive were not even the same brand that I selected online and where my quantity was 2 there was only 1. Basically, for those items I did not receive, the shopper\delivery person just shoplifted my food from the grocery store and that’s theft, larceny! If he works for Instacart as an employee then Instacart should fire him and be totally responsible for correcting my order and then provide me some compensation. There is NO accountability for shopper\delivery person screwing you over other than giving them a bad rating and no tip.

I've used Instacart for over 6 months and until COVID it was great, so I will cut some slack under the current crazy marketplace circumstances.  HOWEVER, this is just about 100% totally inept and dysfunctional customer service.  I placed an order last Friday for evening delivery-- it showed ""order in progress"" for over 2 hours, with only 2 items shopped, and the delivery never showed up.  On the app my order suddenly was listed as to be delivered on Saturday between 3-5pm.  Again, order was ""in progress"" for hours with the same 2 items being shopped.  When I contacted Customer Service via the app-- because they don't take phone calls!-- I was told the shopper ""couldn't complete the order"", whatever that means.  They had no ability to find an alternate shopper so I would need to be rescheduled until Tuesday, nothing open sooner.  Ok, fine, I understand these are unusual times.Today is Tuesday and the adventure continues.  My order was scheduled for 3-5pm delivery.  Yesterday evening I added several additional items I needed, which is a normal process most of the time.  Around 1pm I get text messages from TWO different shoppers who are filling my order-- but there's only one new order pending in my account.  Neither shopper knew how this happened and neither was willing to ""stand down"", and one is asking me to tell the other to stop shopping!  We three each independently reached out to Customer Service.  One shopper is called off the assignment and the other one, very kind woman, continues.  She delivers my groceries about 1 hour later and (can you guess what's coming??) the order is incorrect!  It's an order I placed 2 weeks ago!  Fortunately there were some same items so I wasn't totally out of luck, but I only received about 13 of 37 items I needed.Back to Customer Service I go, and about 25 minutes hanging online later it's determined that Instacart can get a shopper to pick up & deliver the missing items right away.  Keep in mind I've been very firm but patient through all the communication; giving the benefit of the doubt, and catching more flies with honey than vinegar...  The latest shopper starts buying items I already received so I text her about the earlier partial delivery, and I send her a list of what I no longer need.  She stops shopping, needs to check with Customer Service (starting to feel like a CS drinking game at this point), so another 30 minutes passes waiting.  She comes back online and says all is good and she'll continue shopping--great!  But not so great.  She begins to refund nearly every item on my list, so I text her to ask why because I'm confused what CS told her to do.  She said ""I'm refunding the items you received earlier."", and I tell her ""NO, these are the items I DID NOT receive and are supposed to still be delivered.""  I told her if it was easier at this point for me to cancel the order and she can stop shopping, that's fine-- she immediately agreed.Another reach out to CS, I start my chat by saying ""I've talked to 3 agents within a few hours and my order is still totally messed up.  Please put me in touch with a supervisor immediately.""  The CS agent doesn't object and tells me she's transfering me.  I hung online for 15 minutes, then asked ""How's it going finding a supervisor?""  The agent returned after a while to say she was sorry, but they were ""asking for your phone number and email address to contact you directly.  They will call you back.""  Hmmm, will they, I wonder?  I gave her my info, told her I'm accessible anytime, and here I wait. In the meantime, all this BS has resulted in a pending charges on my bank account of over $200-- the actual items I received were less than $70.I agree with an earlier reviewer that 0 stars should be an option.

Just received an Instacart final bill for items delivered yesterday.  Everything went very well and I received all items.  The delivery person brought one (1) package of a different brand of toilet paper and explained why.   This was fine.   I went online and increased the tip on my order.Today I got the instacart final bill.   I was billed for 2 (two) packages of the replacement toilet paper at $10 each, $20 total.   There is no way to contact instacart because their phone line today (April 14, 2020) is not accepting any more calls due to corona virus!   I filled out the online form and submitted it.  I don't know why instacart thinks double charging for a replacement item is acceptable.   I cannot afford to lose $10 this way -- not to mention that just overcharging because I might not notice is outrageous.   I will not be using instacart again.UPDATE -- Surprisingly I got an automated response from Instacart already.   However they refunded me double the overcharge by indicating that I did not get any TP - instead of just the one actual package.   To me this is as much a problem as the overcharge.   I do not want to pay extra and I do not want to pay too little.   I especially hope they are not billing the delivery person for the company's mistake in overcharging me.  I'd give the delivery person a 10 (great!), but the company itself maybe a 2-3 for making not one but two billing errors at this point and for having no customer service people to take my phone call (in addition to emails) to try to straighten this out.   While there is a number to call, the outgoing message is that they are not taking any calls currently because of the CV19 issue."

I then received notification that due to COVID-19 the order delivery date would be pushed back. I understood especially with all that is going on. I then received a notification on Saturday the original order date saying Alisha was shopping for my groceries. I thought that was odd but was happy the groceries were being picked up and delivered on my original date. The shopper sent me notifications of what items were not available, etc and I choose different options. Later I received a call from the shopper saying she was outside. I asked her to leave the items at the door for me to pick up so we would not be in contact with each other. I hung up the phone and walk to the front door and there were no groceries. I called the number back immediately and an automated system said no one was available to answer my call. It even got to the point where my husband and I thought maybe she got the house number mixed up and drive through our community to see if it was on one of our neighbors stairs by accident. That was not the case. I then called Giant who informed me that they are in no way affiliated with Instacart. I went to their website to try and email or chat with someone that way. I then found a place where I could start a chat and so I initiated the request. The automatic message stated they were busy and I was number 2169 in line. I left the chat open and went to bed as it was already 2am in the morning. The next morning the chat disappeared and I received an email asking me to rate my experience with speaking with someone name William. I did not speak with anyone at all. I tried calling again and another automated voice stated I no longer have an order with them and I should visit their website if anything else is needed. I sent a message back to the email requesting a rating but no response their either. Today, Monday April 13th I called the number again where the lady called me from and the phone just rang out with nowhere to leave a message.

I decided to take advantage of the opportunity for home delivery of the items I ordered through InstaCart.  Once I confirmed my order online, the order total was $140.00.  There was a note at the end of the order saying my credit card would be authorized for $160.00 in the event items I ordered needed to be substituted for other items, which could be more expensive.  Seemed reasonable to me.  On April 11, 2020, I noticed a charge on my credit card for $160.00 for Bjs.  The order was scheduled to arrive anywhere between April 11 and April 16, 2020. This was okay as well as I figured many people were using this service and I was not in immediate need for the items I ordered. On April 13, 2020, the items I ordered arrived at my doorstep, as I requested.  When I checked my account at Bjs.com to determine the actual total of my order since some items were substituted, the ordered totaled $148.05, which they said would show up on my credit card statement in 7 business days.  When I checked my credit card balance, I noticed that Bjs initiated another charge on my credit card in the amount of $160.00.  There are now two (2) separate charges  on my credit card for $160.00 each totaling $320.00 for the order I received today.  When I spoke with someone at Bjs, they said InstaCart initiated the charges om my card and I would need to contact them. When I called Instacart's toll free number, there was no response, which I understand.  Therefore, I sent an email, to which an autoreply indicated it would be while before I would get a response.  Here's what I learned, InstaCart will initiate a charge on your credit card the day that you place the order, and they will also initiate another charge on the day the person shops for your order, if they do not occur on the same date.  And, given the high use of the service, this is likely to happen.  So, my credit card was charged $320.00 for $148.05 in grocery items and I cannot get in touch with anyone at InstaCart to correct this matter.  Fortunately, I contacted my credit card company to request a refund of the additional charge.  Buyer beware, if you are overcharged by InstaCart, you'll have significant problems trying to reach someone to correct the problem."

Instacart charges way more than the store does so on top of paying a delivery fee, a service charge, and a tip, you are paying more for the groceries than if you did your own shopping.  My shopper left the Publix receipt in the bag so I could see that I was charged more than $20 more for my groceries and then an additional $17 for their fees and tip.  My shopper didn't bring me all of my items but charged me for them. They weren't even on the Publix receipt.  So, because I have been sick and am a high risk person, I had to pay an additional $37 and then I got screwed for items I didn't even get.  It took me hours trying to get a hold of Publix and Instacart for them to refund the items I didn't receive.

I placed an order March 23rd (3 weeks ago) online, the driver said he had trouble finding the house but I had no way to respond to him using their browser, then the driver marked the groceries as delivered even though they were never delivered. My card was charged $49.68. There was no way to report this online, so I called Instacart's customer service line. I was on hold for TWO HOURS before they just hung up on me without a rep ever coming to the phone. Then I found an email for customer service and emailed them. No response. I called again a few days later and got put on hold for another 1.5 hours before they hung up...again, I didn't get to speak to a rep. I emailed them again. No response. I waited two weeks before sending a third email. No response. Then I tried calling again but they had a new automated message saying they aren't accepting customer service calls...what?@?? By then they had created a chat option, so I tried that...no response. THEN just to rub salt in the wound, I get an automated email from Instacart asking how my experience with Juan was and whether I was satisfied with my customer service...what customer service??!? I was never contacted by anyone and never spoke to a Juan or anyone else. I just tried going back to their website and now the chat option isn't available anymore. I have NEVER had such a terrible experience with customer service before, and I've dealt with multiple cable companies. They essentially just stole my money and wasted hours of my life."

On top of that there was a $3.99 delivery fee, 5% Service fee ($12.50) and i was nice enough to pay a 5% tip ($12.50) which was paid shen i checked out my order.  The Salmon I purchased has the price tag of $22.00, I was charged $31.00.  The Ground beef was $10.50, i paid $16.00, and so on.

My shopper started by texted me about my item being unavailable, as I opened it saw options to choose similar items, before I could finish making a choice, another text arrived, then another, then another 11 in all. As I frantically tried to make choices, one after the other, I noticed many choices were twice the price for less product. As a senior on a fixed income I could not afford paying twice the price. I texted the shopper and told her of this. She snapped back saying "" what do you want, I'm doing the best I can.""  As more texts came in to replace items, I tried to select replacements, but with half my order unavailable, I texted her to cancel my order, she ignored my text completely and sent notice of her checking out. I still had more than half the item to review and replace. At that exact time my ability to do anything on the app was over, and was told delivery would be in 20 mins. I texted again to cancel, as my order was half missing or replaced with things I didn't want. I only ordered 19 items, and knew at least half I wasn't getting, the rest, who knows, yet still paying the service fee and tip, over $12. She arrived at my house and I told her I had cancelled my order, but she ignored it. I told her I wasn't excepting it and she got really nasty and rude. When I asked when I would get my refund, she would not talk to me, I kept asking, and was ignored. She slammed her trunk, got in her car and sped off like a maniac. She may have been 18 yrs old, very cocky and unprofessional. I called customer support 5 times and waited on hold for 30 mins plus. The last time I called and was on hold 4 hours to the minute and at that time they disconnected. They charged my card $116, and never refunded a penny. I tried phoning, emailing and no one has gotten back to me in two weeks, yet they are bringing in billions of dollars, with a one star overall review and not dealing with customer issues.

I regretted those experiences so much that I decided not to use them again. Here is a summary of what I saw in those two trips:1- Shoppers are clueless. It took the guy to do back and forth with me about what to buy and what to replace for over 2 hours. How come a shopping list containing around 10 items take that long. In the end I received my delivery but icecream was melted and leaked also I realized that I did not receive some of the items but still got charged for them (market receipt does not match the web receipt in terms of the items purchased) 2-Their mark up is pretty steep. On top of instacart express fee, service fee and shopper tip I still need to pay a mark up on every item on my list. This bussiness model can not survive. They should make deals with the groceries and get special discounts rather than putting the extra fee on the customer.3- For both my trips I had issues with items that I got charged for but did not receive ( I have market receipts to confirm this claim) However no matter howmany times I tried to reach them they were not accessible. So over two weeks from my purchase I am yet to find someone to discuss about my refund...I cancelled my instacart express membership and will not consider using this service ever again.

I place an order on 4/6/20. Never heard a word from Instacart. In the meantime, I read on Facebook and NextDoor that Instacart basically stopped shopping and delivering. So, I just assumed I was never going to see my order. Then, early this afternoon I start getting emails from the shopper. What a fricken nightmare. Every 30 seconds, he texted that an item was unavailable. Then, the next 30 seconds, do I want a replacement. This went on and on for over an hour. I ordered 26 items, and got 10. Only the milk and wine were actual items I ordered. Then, there was an item charged to me that I didn't receive. Then, I compared the receipt given to me by the driver and the receipt spit out by Instacart. There was over $21 in discrepancies. . .to Instacart's favor. A ham I bought was $22.31 on my receipt from the store, but $39.12 in Instacart's receipt. That price was even higher than the regular price of the ham ($33.62) - the in store sale of $11.21 = $22.I cannot even figure out how dispute the charges. Plus, there was over $19 in charges. No where did it say there was a $2 alcohol fee until I hit confirm order. That royally ticked me off. Then, there was a delivery fee and a service fee and a tip and a bag fee. Really? This was so not worth it. I will never do this again. It was an utter rip off. I feel so stupid for doing it. I wished I listened to my gut."

It is still listed as 'New' meaning nobody's currently looking for my groceries or even close to delivering it. You know what I have in my fridge? Water and a single radish.

BS waste of time. (Also as an after note I didn't even realize there was a tip option, it was left as default. I saw on the news instacart shoppers are only shopping for those who tip a lot. That must've been the problem, which is honestly also BS.) This is a company which means someone has to fulfill the agreement even if they're not happy about getting a low tip (also as a sidenote I would've tipped a lot more than the default if I'd known it was there). What about the poor elderly who need groceries delivered and can't tip? Just going to leave them on 'New' and let them starve? Whole thing is crap, I will never order through it again."

I had Instacart for a free trial. As soon as I placed an order and I gave my credit card information to pay, they charged the $99 fee. Of course it is nonrefundable. My problem with Instacart is the higher price you pay for the products you are buying. In some cases, items are 20%+ the normal cost if you bought it in the store. Trash bags at Sam’s are $14.99. If purchased through Insta cart they are $18.50. What a rip off. Based on the reviews  of Instacart, in spite of Covid-19, they won’t be in business long."

At least show proof that you're at the correct address and door, so you one can contact Instacart immediately of a problem.  Amazon does this with their package deliveries.  Waiting and waiting just to get a text that your order has been delivered is upsetting.  So far a huge flawed service and costly ripoff.

What happened to the free delivery on orders over $35?Of course I thought it would be an easy fix, just contact them, right? NOT! They don't answer the phone, don't answer chat, the directions to report a problem with the order are incorrect.

Then when you call to report it to the store they say nothing they can do about it and that you have to contact instacart. When you call instacart, they are not in office due to covid19.

While this is a trying time for all, if a company is offering a pay service to help those who can not shop, they need to rethink their business, who they are hiring and how these people are being trained.  The final straw was a shopper who repeatedly texted that the items were either not available or wanted to substitute.   We understand that not all things are in stock right now.  We had no high value items on the list such as cleaners and paper products.  All items were pretty basic and while a few out of stock is reasonable - not 50% of the list.  As it turned out, a friend happened to be in the store at the same time as our Instacart shopper.  She texted that some paper products had just been delivered in case we were in need.  I asked her to check on 5 items that our shopper claimed to be unavailable.   All 5 products were in the store and stocked.  When placing the order, I requested that the items not be dropped at the door.  Ring showed the shopper, who was not wearing protection, dropping them at the door and leaving.  My biggest regret is pre-selecting a generous tip. We have gone to the store a few times when absolutely necessary.   It is obvious now who the insta cart shoppers are.  They are moving hurriedly through isles, obvious they don’t know the layout, constantly texting on the visible Instacart app without much focus on the requests at hand. It is no wonder they don’t find what is being requested.  Yesterday I did not see one shopper wearing gloves or mask and often did not follow distancing guidelines.  Unacceptable."

I completely understand we are in the middle of a global pandemic and the demand for these type of services has skyrocketed, leaving many businesses overwhelmed. With that being said this is the absolute worst service I have ever used, if you can even call it a service. I highly believe I was frauded. Please take note of mine and others reviews on here and DO NOT USE INSTACART. This was my first time using this service just like a lot of others because of the quarantine. I placed my order on 4/9 for flexible delivery, which basically you get delivered whenever someone is available. It was scheduled for delivery latest today 4/10 in the evening, however I received a notification on same day as ordered that the shopper was already shopping for it. Not terrible I was pretty impressed at that point that it was going to be delivered early. All downhill from there. This was a large 135 dollar order and every 30 seconds I was responding to a message from the shopper about a replacement or refund for out of stock items. Some items were to be replaced with items that costed more and were less quantity and items were refunded that I personally know the grocery store has because I shop there a lot. Out of hummus? Really? With no replacements? Is hummus a high commodity item in a pandemic?. Anyways, after all of that I get a notification that the shopper is checking out, great right? Wrong! About 2 minutes later I get a text from the shopper that she has to cancel my order because her instacart pay card was stolen. At this point I was over it already and honestly happy that this was going to be cancelled and get my money back. Wrong again! After inquiring how I get refunded for the cancelled order, the shopper states that they are on hold with the instacart support. After about 20 minutes I follow up with the shopper and turns out they disconnected the chat! So no way to contact the shopper or anything! Furthermore, the order was never cancelled via instacart so my order still shows that it is active and being shopped for which is causing a hold on my bank account of 135 dollars. Naturally, after this issue you would think to contact some kind of customer service to get the issue solved which I attempted, however instacart literally has ZERO customer service options. No phone line available to speak with someone, email? well you just get a generic auto reply that directs you to the app to chat via text. Well I go the app to chat and guess what? I’m number 5,000 + in line to chat! After leaving the chat open for about 10 hours, I get no response and it actually kicks me out of the chat! Unbelievable! So, I’m fed up with no food, and 135 dollars practically stolen from me, with no resolution in sight. IS THIS HOW YOU RUN A BUSINESS! Finally, I just resorted to calling my bank (which I was on hold with them for almost 2 hours to get to the clams department) to dispute the charge to get my money back. TAKE MY ADVICE!WRAP A T SHIRT AROUND YOUR FACE, WASH YOUR HANDS AND JUST GO TO THE STORE YOURSELF. INSTACART IS A WASTE OF TIME, MONEY, AND STRESS THAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY DONT NEED. BEWARE! RUN AS FAR AS YOU CAN FROM THEM AND NEVER LOOK BACK!"

The order was done after the hours of things like the deli counter closed, which was not supposed to happen, which cancelled those items.  The driver left the instacart receipt-  which was 19.00 less then we were charged.  No one answers at instacart to speak to.  So we were charged 19.00 more to pay online prices I guess, a10+ dollar service fee, a 3.99 delivery fee...and the order was done after hours, causing items to be cancelled.  I will NOT use this service again, which is unfortunate during a time when we are supposed to attempt to stay out of stores."

The $3.99 delivery fee disclosure is fine but it hid the other fees.  Instacart reminds me of Comcast with its ever higher, undisclosed service fees, etc.  When I used Instacart's pickup service, store employees filled the order.  Out of 10 items, I received 4 and paid $1.99 for the poor service.  I went into the store after the employee brought out one bag before going back inside.  After grabbing a cart, I found all 6 items I wanted still on the shelves.  I even found multiple substitutes which I permitted, too.  I'll never use this service again.

A very simple order.  It was three hours late.  That's not a big deal. But about 4 of the 9 or so items we ordered didn't come at all.  One of the orders was just wrong (substituting paper towels for toilet paper, how does that work?).  They threw some cloves of garlic in the order, that we hadn't ordered.  Maybe they think we're vampires or something.  So I went to the website to try to straighten things out.  There is no way to reach anyone.  For chat I was something like 5,964 in line.  If these bozos are this disorganized, I can't see how we'll get our money back.  When all is said and done we probably paid about twice what the items were worth.  So we're back to the old fashioned way, we'll go to the grocery store like the good old days."

By then the Sprouts store had been cleaned out during the day by fools who were NOT practicing the social-distancing as strongly recommended by Federal, State and Local authorities.The most disturbing thing about this Instacart experience, however, is that three items that she didn’t cancel and refund for being unavailable were not delivered and yet we were billed for them. Adding those to the four that she cancelled and refunded, there were 7 of 18 items (40%) that we ordered, but didn’t get, even though the Sprouts website showed that they were available.      Apparently, person that Insta-cart hired to make this shopping/delivery run didn’t consider it to be a priority. By contrast to this experience, our first experience with another store last week resulted in delivery of 80% of the items we had requested.

I was horrified especially with the ongoing pandemic that Instacart would not vet who works on their platform.  I immediately reported the issue to Instacart with no response for several days. After sending several emails, a failed chat that closed on its own after 3 hours waiting time after giving me an estimate of 59 minutes, and a phone call to Sprouts for help later, I got an email from Instacart saying that they will give me $4 in credit to use on my next Instacart purchase. $4 doesn't even cover one of the several items that never arrived, and I have no intent to use them ever again given their poor service, lack of quality control, and business practices that are akin to thievery.

They’re not a shop and DELIVER company, they’re a RESALE company, which I don’t even know if it’s legal given they advertise for delivery. They inflated the price on every item, and you have no say. You can easily be cheated 20% more on the price tag. 4. Then for items that need to be weighed. The weight they show is always approximate, so they can get away with it with the lowest weight that you wouldn’t complain. So they can make the difference. And you can’t dispute it with real receipt. 5. Customer service is extremely horrible, long wait which says 30 mins then I waited for 4 hours which I understand due to corona. But the service agent uses policy that plays word games so you can’t get your cheated money back.

The person that did the shopping in Publix in Pompano Beach for instacart was dishonest. The app displayed the item that supposedly she picked up from the shopping list. Then she sent me a chat message saying that she forgot to pick up the package of toilet tissue that I ordered. She said that since she had already finished scanning all the items, she could instead buy the package of toilet tissue herself and I could reimburse her on delivery. I asked her how much was the package of toilet tissue that she was buying and she reply that it was 18.18. When she delivered my order I looked at the toilet tissue package of 12 cottonelle mega roll that she said cost 18.18. That package I know for fact cost less than 13 dollars every where including publix. I like a good samaritan gave her 20 dollars and told her to keep the change for her troubles. Once I got to my apartment and saw the package and checked the prices all over the internet for, yes indeed the price is less than 13 dollars. She is such a dishonest person.In addition,  when I looked at the online receipt in instacart, I noticed that they ate charging me for a roll of toilet tissue that she mentioned on her chat that she forgot to pick up?So I am being charge for something that she said she forgot to pick up and she realized it after finishing scanning the whole order?. What a scammer!! And in top of that she charged me and inflated 18.18 for a package of 12 rolls of toilet tissue to reimburse her for her mistake?.I learn my lesson I will never use Instacart and their sleazy shoppers ever again."

I mean THE REAL KICKER IN THE KNICKER: I placed my order on Sunday and they promised it by Wednesday. Today I got an update saying I won't have my groceries until 'Sunday or later'. So I went to Aldi myself and started shopping.  While I was there I got a text saying somebody is putting my items in their cart now. I found that person and she'd only put 4 items in the cart and she told me she would cancel it out and I got multiple texts stating my order has been cancelled.A FEW HOURS LATER I got a text stating another person was on their way to my house with $150 worth of groceries! I had to rush home and do my best to make room in my fridge for this stuff I hope doesn't spoil. I'm still not sure what I'm going to do with the $30 worth of crap I didn't want.Another shady tactic they're practicing is purposely NOT sending you a receipt after you make the credit card purchase. They do this so they can change the order anytime they want and you have very little proof unless you take screenshots. I can't believe this company is in business."

Groceries are expensive enough but once you pay all of their fees and tip the shopper, it is expensive. I chose the least expensive delivery fee; $3.99 and yet they charged me $12.98. I’m looking everywhere to find out who I can contact But don’t see a phone number or any place where I can click to contact. You are at the mercy of the shop or when it comes to choosing items and they really don’t choose things the way you personally would so it’s a little disappointing. The shopper said she couldn’t find several of the items so now I still have to go to the store. And here’s the thing that bothers me the most. They charge you a very large amount to cover what they think the bill could be in case there are expensive substitutions. They hold on to that for a week before they release it. Basically, they deducted $290 from my account But the actual charges were $170. So I won’t see the credit for a week. That’s ridiculous!"

https://ca.trustpilot.com/reviews/5e8dc3d6086b6409bc7ff146,Jacob Vandenberg,1 star: Bad,I was really excited to use Instacart…,"I was really excited to use Instacart when I heard about them several weeks ago but haven't used them until now (4/8/20). I wish that I had seen this site before using them. Like others who have posted here, I had a recent bad experience with using Instacart and haven't received my order despite my account indicating that my order has been delivered. It's really feeling like this might be a scam. In a nutshell, I ordered from Instacart yesterday afternoon. Instacart indicated that they could get my order to me within two hours so I was THRILLED (as most of you know, it's literally impossible to get deliveries within a few days or even weeks due to the current COVID-19 crisis). The shopper texted me from the store and indicated that there were two items that were unavailable, which didn't seem strange to me because the stores are out of A LOT of items right now. The shopper and I went back and forth a few times over text because I wanted to know what my options were and there weren't many choices. I texted the shopper that it was fine to get a generic brand or anything else that was similar to the product that I had originally ordered. By this point, we're almost 2 hours into when I originally placed the order. Then, I get a message that the shopper is on their way to my house and immediately after that I get another message stating that they delivered the order (how is it possible that they were on the way and delivered the order at the same time? I figured the shopper might have done both at the house or it might be a glitch in the app or something else). Anyway, I was home so I immediately went to the door and my order was NOT there. Similar to other people on this site, I looked around the house and there is nothing. I also looked in the mailbox which is extra-large so that you can fit packages in there and NOTHING. I immediately texted the shopper who I had just been texting with to let them know that they went to the wrong address and the system blocks me from communicating with the shopper (I guess the program is set up that communication stops after delivery which makes sense to me but not if there is a problem; we could have remedied the problem immediately if the shopper was actually at the incorrect location). I immediately call the number for Instacart and I can't get a rep on the phone and a message from them states that I need to contact them through the app. I go to the chat box to explain what transpired and there is no response. I leave the chat box open all night long and there is still no response the next day. I just received a message from Instacart (like others) that they rescheduled the delivery without my permission and the delivery is now slated for ""Wed-Mon"" (no specific day or time given!). Looking at many of these reviews, now I'm worried that I won't get the delivery and will be charged for it. Mind you I gave the shopper a good tip because they were able to shop so quickly. I don't understand how the shopper could have delivered it to the wrong address. I'm in a location that is densely populated with clear street signs everywhere in a house that is easily identifiable even without GPS. I'm really disappointing with Instacart because I had high hopes for this service but it's clear to me that there are some glitches in their program that need to be worked out. I won't use them again until they can sort all of this out."

Over the next hour she continued to contact us saying what she could or couldn't find and what she was substituting for some of the items that were out. At 6:46 she texted and said she would be on the way and should arrive in 20 minutes. That evening I tried to contact Instacart only to be told there was a 389 minute wait until I might be able to talk to someone. I didn't wait.She never arrived and she did not respond to texts asking what was going. The next day I contacted the store she had been shopping at. I was told they had no connection with Instacart and I would need to contact them for help. I called the Kroger help line and was told the same information. I called Instatacart and waited this time about an hour until I could speak to someone. The woman I spoke to said she would contact Kroger and tell them to refund my money. She also said someone from Kroger would contact me the next day by phone or by e-mail. Three days later there has been no contact.At this point clearly the three customer service people I have spoken have lied to me.  When I checked my bank statement I saw Fred Meyer had with drawn the money from my checking account, and in fact it was the Fred Meyer which I had called and was told they had nothing to do with Instacart.At this point I consider Instacart and Kroger to be running a continuing criminal enterprise. Kroger sends people to Instacart from the Fred Meyer app thus appearing to a reasonable person to be vouching for their service. Kroger thru Fred Meyer then gets the victim's money while deny having anything to do with Instacart. Instacart says they will tell Kroger to refund the victim's money, which it appears they do not do.As a result I have contacted our bank and disputed the charge.

There is absolutely no sales you get. No discounts. No price cuts. So for example you buy from Sams club then they hand you the receipt. Instacart charged $637 everyday prices plus over $60 in fees with free delivery, so $713 total. Actual receipt upon checkout was $574.  That’s $135 less in your pocket.

Today the shopper thought it would be wise to substitute my coconut milk with EXPIRED dairy milk. The other day, my microwave rice, which was being used as a donation was substituted with a huge bag of dried brown rice with a huge hole in the bag. It was all over my kitchen floor. My paper towels were replaced with a huge box of napkins that cost twice the price. I can't get in touch with anyone. I feel so ripped off.

https://ca.trustpilot.com/reviews/5e8b8bbd086b6409543126ea,Ivko Cvejic,1 star: Bad,Instacart is a terrible company that should go away,"It is a complete mystery to me how this company is still in business. I thought using their service would be a smart move, both for myself and the general public during this pandemic.I purchased about $200 in groceries, paid their ""expedite"" charge, and left a generous (I think) tip of roughly $30 for the shopper; I appreciate the shoppers who are putting themselves out there during the pandemic for us and didn't want to cheap out on them. At first everything seemed great. I got some text messages about the progress of filling my order, authorized a few substitutions, and got an estimated delivery time for that morning. Then it all fell apart spectacularly.I received a message stating ""hurray, your order has been delivered!"" Except, of course, it most certainly had not. I immediately texted back to say ""hey, whatever you delivered was to the wrong address"", only to get a message stating that I couldn't reply to the text messages I had received. Ok, tried calling customer support. Nope, customer support recorded message just says they no longer do phone based customer support. Ok, how about their site? I selected the form option that said my order had not been received and got a canned reply that they were very busy but a customer support agent would jump on the chat soon. 5 hours later and nothing. By now I'm fuming; there's no way I'm paying $270 (about my total charges) for a non-existent ""service"". Called my credit card company to dispute the charges, only to find that Instacart had cancelled the order themselves.So I get to keep my money, but what a COMPLETE waste of time and effort. How in the world does this company stay in business with such an absurdly chaotic and unreliable process? From the VAST numbers of complaints, it seems like it's hit or miss that any order gets completed at all, wasting their shopper's time and resources, the customers time and resources, and, I'm guessing, piles of investor money. Whoever is running this poop show (swear word replaced, but you know what I mean) should be fired and replaced with someone with an ounce of competence.And frankly, I'm not sympathetic to the ""but it's so busy right now"" argument. Creating order from the chaos of high demand is literally what they are being paid for. If it only works when there is an orderly stream of demand the shoppers could just go into business for themselves and fulfill orders directly with customers. Optimizing that work flow and keeping everything running smoothly is their whole business model, and they are failing miserably. You want to see it done right, look at Amazon. They are also getting slammed by massive increases in demand, but they kept it under control by efficiently slicing the demand into different levels of priority and adjusted delivery time expectations to make sure the important stuff (mostly) gets through quickly while less important orders might have to take a bit longer to fulfill. Is it perfect? No, of course not. But it's still functional, while as far as I can see Instacart is crumbling into chaos at the expense of their shoppers and serious unhappiness of customers, while the company adopts a ""who cares, plenty of customers right now"" attitude towards it all."
https://ca.trustpilot.com/reviews/5e8b8aef086b6409bc7eaa08,Kim Konerza Dorman,1 star: Bad,"Consistently stressful, inaccurate experience","Insanely stressful, inaccurate experience every time! I have had several consistently bad experiences with Instacart, starting BEFORE all the COVID-19 madness. My first shopper got several items incorrect, so I had to go to teh store myself for the items I needed. For example, I ordered several cases of soda and got 5 *cans*, but they still charged me for the price of a 5 cases. She also brought me bad produce and several other items were also wrong. I paid a lot of money so I could save time during the busy work week only to have to still go to the store and do my own shopping. When I emailed instacart support for refunds and to express my dissatisfaction, it took FIVE emails to get them to not try to sell me an upgraded experience and to at least refund me for the bad produce. I still didn't get refunded for my Instacart fee.Moving on to COVID-19 deperation, I reluctantly ordered from Instacart again. This time,  I had a really respponsive and communicative shopper who texted me about all replacements and asked what I wanted to do. My only 5-star experience wtih this company. Shopping trip 3, my shopper kept cancelling items without asking if I wanted to replace. Very non-communicative, and when I asked her to add a loaf of bread, she told me no because the store was closing. When I asked how many items she had left to get, she said 16. I don't want my shopper to rush through and get bad produce, miss items, not have them check in the back if items aren't out (ALDI often has items in back, and that's where I have them go). For the $$$ I pay to have this service, I want my order to be right adn to be complete. After several messages back and forth, I just had her cancel the order, as I was getting more adn more stressed when items were cancelled and knowing the store was closing.Shoppping trip 4, my shopper was moderately communicative and I was able to get most of what I wanted, with lots of texting of instructions. Still, several items I asked her not to replace showed up in my cart, even after I asked her not to get them. I asked her to add quantities to several items I ordered (ex: 2 pkgs of tortillas instead of 1) and she told me she was being timed by Instacart, so she didn't like to add items. She also texted me to ask if I could reduce my order because she didn't think she could fit all my items in her car. I told her they should all fit in her trunk, as they do in mine. She replied that she can't use her trunk. We got through that and I awaited delivery. I got a text that the items were out front, so went outside after my text came that my groceries had been left (social distancing, so I asked her to leave them), and they WEREN'T THERE. Nowhere. I tried to call the instacart number but there was a 2 hr wait. I tried to log a complaint in my account, but I could only leave a review. Later, my neighbor let me know she had my order sitting in the sun in her driveway. The meat was room temperature, the ice cream was melted, and I have to drive over, load it all in my car and then unload it all at home. Instacart is insanely stressful, expensive and a waste of time. They offer zero customer support (I doubt I'll ever be contact3ed about my experience or refunded for all the items that rotted or were incorrect), zero support for their shoppers (I asked my shopper to contact her employer for help if her car was too small and she said she had no way to reach them) and, as far as I can tell, zero training. If I could give zero stars, I would."

While the delivery girl was very nice, she did not include my grocery receipt.  After going online I found it.  The receipt showed 9 items that I did not order, that totaled over $40.  And no, they were not replacements.  I never even received the 9 items that appeared (out of nowhere) on my bill.  In fact, several of the items were things I have never used in my life.  I tried calling Instacart customer service, but the recording says to go online and follow instructions for delivery problems.  I tried this several times with no luck.  Finally I found the website and emailed them.  They quickly emailed me back and told me to call them or download the app on my phone.  If I am understanding the app correctly, it costs $99 annually to join.  After investing 2 hours in trying to correct the problem, I finally gave up.  They can keep the $40.  I consider it a school fee (for learning not to use them again).  I promptly cancelled my next two orders.

I told them I wanted them to call me about it, that was a week ago. I tried to call, but the auto message says 125 minute wait.

We repainted shortly after and I advised that was not our house. She said it was where the GPS had sent her. I wrote back telling her our house is grey. She said she would contact customer support to try to find out what to do and then shut off contact. It was a large order of approx. $300. This seems to be happening to alot of people now.

I’ve placed two orders so far and unfortunately neither one worked well. The first order was supposed to be delivered on the same day. It showed a shopper was shopping for hours. After numerous delay messages, it asked me to reschedule. When I called in to reschedule, the new delivery date I was offered was five days later. I ended up going into the store. The second order was more ridiculous. The order was placed on 3/30 with delivery on 4/4. On 4/4, the cart showed ‘shopping in progress’ for hours, then I got a text message saying due to high demand, I would get my order by 4/10, which is another 6 days away. 2 orders. 0% success.

My husband and I are 70 and 71, retired, house-bound due to Covid 19, and now victimized by a fictitious shopper named Fakeshia R through Instacart. I mean, her name says it all:  Fake-shia. Very funny. She, via the Instacart app, contacted me on Saturday, April 4, texting that items I ordered on March 30 were finally being shopped for us. When she was done shopping, contact stopped with a message that delivery was scheduled for no later than 2:30 PM.  I checked Instacart at about 3:00 PM to track my order, which had not been delivered, and there was a message indicating delivery had been made at 1:55 PM. So I guess some criminal part-time Instacart employee is having Fakes fulfill orders and making off with the goods.  Fortunately, I can survive a theft, though it's terrible upsetting.  It's now 7:00 PM.  I cannot get through to Instacart by phone, email, their app or website--nothing! Instacart is either a terribly run company or a criminal enterprise. Kroger has no record of the transaction either.  Whatever you do, don't trust this service!!!"

Refreshed page, they reappeared. I removed item by item a second time, refreshed page, still there. I cancelled order in total under ""your orders,"" refreshed page. Did this also twice. I removed my credit card from my newly opened account. Finally, site shows order has been cancelled.My grocery items total was $198.00. Then a service fee was charged ($3.99). Then a delivery fee was charged ($13.00). Then a mandatory tip of 5% was added ($10 and change), with the recommendation I increase this tip. This brings the total to $240 change for my $198.00 bill.  THEN an additional $35 fee was added. When I looked into this additional fee, I was informed on Instacart website that prices may not be in finality as they are indicated on grocery store site (evidencing blatant and undisclosed price gouging on the part of Instacart), and there are videos available from other reviewers expaining that I would be charged per mile for delivery (Instacart selected a Safeway location downtown, when I live precisely .5 mile from a closer Safeway--this is also demonstrable). Instacart itself does not disclose this additional delivery fee. So my $198 (including tax) grocery total is suddenly $275. My credit card was then charged an ADDITIONAL $275 AFTER I cancelled this order REPEATEDLY, for a total of $550 for NO ITEMS,  NO SERVICES, and demonstrably CANCELLED ORDER.There is no way a business can charge you repeatedly for demonstrably cancelled goods or services. (Screenshots of website and texts confirm cancelled order.) I will be contacting Fraud Department at my bank to dispute charges. This case is so extreme, there may be legal implications.This incident and the $550 charged to my credit card would be stressful for anybody. But additionally so for me, as I have an autoimmune disease and have been advised not to go shopping during the COVID-19 pandemic. My household consists of three adults currently unemployed due to conditions of the pandemic. How any business can profit from the situation is abhorrent in itself, but to charge for items not delivered and services not rendered is outright theft."

The shopper, Florence, did a horrible job. She would not respond to my questions initially about what substitutions she made for products I carefully selected(due to family with multiple food allergies) until I confronted her about it via a text. I have always in the past been able to have an exchange with my shopper to ensure appropriate substitutions. She did a poor job selecting several different types of produce ; the shoppers usually do in my opinion. Approximately 1/3 of my order was missing due to the items being unavailable at this particular King Soopers. When she arrived, we had a talk about the experience. I talked, and she mostly listened because I was so angry with her customer service skills. She told me that she was limited to a one hour block of time for an order of this size. IMHO, this is not enough time to shop a large order. I am assuming that Instacart shoppers get some kind of training before they start the job, but it was not reflected in Florence's shopping.

He told me to just keep them and figure it out. So I looked on our credit card transactions and we were charged for both orders when we only placed the order once.

I called them and was on hold for 3 HOURS and 18 min!

Obviously, I didn’t have time to go back and reorder everything and send it again in 1 min, and I don’t need double milk, bananas, cheese etc... he put me on hold came back to tell me he couldn’t refund it, and asked if I received the groceries? I said yes, but I don’t want them! I’ll gladly return them!! I informed him I’m not paying $110 for a double order I didn’t order, that’s not my fault, and a glitch on your end! He put me on hold again, because he said “this is a difference of opinion, and he didn’t know what to do” then 15 min later on hold I was hung up on and then sent a text from a number I am unable to respond to that says “we have given you a refund as a one time courtesy. It will be credited to your account within 3-5 days.” didn’t tell me what was being refunded! Was it the $110 double charge, was it the $160 random charge!!

I have a tan house with no fence at all and my number on my mail box. The app said delivered we said we have not received any groceries. She sent us her number and when we called her. That’s when we found out she delivered to a red house. My husband found a red house with a white fence and the lady said she had no groceries. I spent over 5 hours on hold and sent two complaints online and got an email back that they would get back with me. That was yesterday and I’ve heard nothing back and still have no groceries delivered or charges taken off my card. The driver was not trained on what to do when she delivers to the wrong house and had no way to contact anyone at insta cart to let them know of the error. I’ve never had a driver deliver to the wrong house before so I’ve never had to deal with their customer service. After this incident I will never use them again and I will highly suggest against anyone using them.

Sat on hold with them for an hour and 15 minutes, finally explained what happened. The gal told me she would have to transfer me over to Instacart so they could track the shopper's GPS. The wait time would be at 130 minutes, drop to 45 minutes, go back up to 103 minutes, down to 55, then back up to 120 minutes! Sat on hold for 2 hours and 23 minutes before giving up and going to sleep. Called them early this morning to get this process started again. On hold for another 4 hours and 35 minutes! Finally got through to someone, they checked the shopper's GPS and confirmed they were never delivered even though I had paid almost $150 for them. Was told that I will be getting a full refund in about 7-10 days. Thankful to be getting my money back, but I still need my groceries, and with the quarantine and the high demand for grocery delivery I can't get them until Sunday night.

Of course it's closed….it's 10pm! And it wasn't supposed to be delivered until the next day anyway. She says she'll shop it in the morning and deliver it at 9:30am. The next day, April 2nd, no delivery and I can no longer text her. I go into my Instacart account and see that Fred is now shopping my order but I haven't gotten any text from Fred and none of the items are being purchased. All day, it's said that Fred is shopping, and the delivery day/time has changed. I cannot cancel or modify the order. When I call the wait time is over an hour and no one ever picks up. When I sent an email, no one responded, and the ""report a problem"" button on the app just takes you to the order, no place at all to report the problem. This seems like a scam to me. It's literally said Fred's been shopping my cart since 8:00am; however nothing's been purchased. I had to cancel my credit card and file a dispute. I never got the food. I never heard from Fred. It's terrible that Instacart is stealing from people and taking advantage of us at such a terrible time in our country. They stole my money and never provided ANY groceries at all whatsoever."

The shopper delivered the items on Wednesday, April 1st. What in the world? Does that selection seriously mean anytime before Monday at noon? If so, that's absurd and deceptive. You literally click on a box that says ""Monday.""Because of this, the refrigerated items sat for hours and hours, and I had to throw them away.

There are hidden charges associated with orders.  A 5% service charge is automatically added to the cost of the order based on the initial projected cost of the order.  Another 5% is also added as a tip.  In addition to these charges, there is an ""upcharge"" added to each item ordered, which means that you're paying more than the regular online price established by the vendor, e.g., Sam's Club.2.  There is no receipt provided at the time of delivery to reconcile the charged items with those actually delivered.  In my particular case, items were charged, but not delivered.3.  After discovering the discrepancies associated with my order and delivery, I reported the problem online; however, at the time of this review, which is a day later, I have received no correction to the charge and no response from Instacart.As a result of the aforementioned issues, I will NOT be utilizing Instacart again.

I understand that during this is a very busy time, and probably more people are ordering groceries rather than going to the grocery store. However, my shoppers made substitutions that I would not have made, and without my authorization. In a couple instances, they brought the wrong products. The order had been promised between 6 and 7 PM, which was not ideal. However, after several emails stating the shoppers were delayed, the last order arrived at 8:30 PM.My last order with Instacart was scheduled for March 23rd for items from a CVS drugstore. Instacart sent me an email saying they canceled the order because the store didn’t have the desired items. In the email, i was told my account had been credited. To date, that has not been reflected in my bank account, and it had been impossible to reach anyone at the Instacart Customer Service phone line.Instacart did not make a very good first impression with me."

An order we waited a week for we were notified as delivered. As soon as we had the text we went to the door, though requested to ring the doorbell, there was no ring. Our security camera shows no delivery. This afternoon my wife calls Instacart and waited over 2 hours to speak to an agent. Described the issue and the agent placed my wife on hold, came back on the phone and couldn’t hear my wife so hung up. We get a call back and they still can’t hear us, no more contact from a Instacart. We don’t have a problem with our cell, the problem is all with Instacart. I am currently waiting for an agent on a call I started 2 hours and 39 minutes ago, initial estimated wait time was 104 minutes. I have sent a comment explaining our issue on the survey they send after an order is logged as delivered but no email acknowledgment of my comments.  After almost 3 hours on hold, the robo estimate is now 128 minutes. I can handle waits for delivery, I can handle understandable call wait times and I understand mistakes but this is different. I live on a Cul de sac with about 10 homes so no excuse for a wrong address but my security shows nobody came. Show a little effort and talk to me and also don’t let the driver do this to someone else."

The company is JUST NOW supplying them with hand sanitizer, and they aren't getting hazard pay, and tips are somehow not required during this time. Also, their paid sick leave that they boast about is only if they can prove they've tested positive for COVID 19, and we all know how hard it is to get tested in the US right now. I encourage you all to abstain from using IC right now until the employees demands are met. I am a member of Instacart Express and it has been a huge convenience to have. However, the shoppers that are on the frontlines have been the reason why I loved IC so much. They do the hard work and they deserve to be taken care of accordingly. If you are in a situation where you must use IC, PLEASE tip how you would want to be tipped if you were shopping and delivering strangers' groceries during a pandemic and your job didn't supply you with any safety equipment or health insurance. Thank you."

I placed my order this afternoon and I heard from my shopper at 6:58 pm stating that ""Mo..."" just started shopping.  He had sent several emails about replacing items.  You can see what items are picked up already and he had half the order to go and my last message from him was a little before 8:55 pm when I received the text message that the delivery was on its way and the estimated time was 8:55 pm.  1) This was an extremely slow shopper, especially with getting dairy items first.   I waited, waited, and I even turned the TV off so that I could hear if anyone pulled up and nothing.  I kept going to the door and going outside to look around in case the groceries were left in the driveway, nothing.  It wasn't very convenient to find a way to contact them, but I did and have been on hold since 9:52 pm.  It is now after 1 am.  Luckily, I am up doing work so I am not wasting my time waiting for someone to pick up the phone. The automated message keeps telling me that I have a shorter time, then it goes to a longer time.  i.e., original wait time was 62 minutes, then 32, then 68, 42, 21, 23, and the 32, and just now 101 minutes (time 1:07 am).  Screw that!   I also sent several emails, with absolutely no response.  My order was over $100. Once again I looked outside and nothing! I had a lot of dairy and frozen products included with my order.  I'm sure that none of it is good if my order is sitting somewhere unattended for over 4 hours now.  Has anyone had any luck getting their money back from Instacart?  I know that Schucks has nothing to do with the company or your service you get from them, which I don't understand why, since that is the delivery service they are offering on their website.  BTW, I did not choose the leave at the door option, so they cannot say that they just left it at the door because of no answer.  I have been home waiting the entire time!"

I went back to the website with the same frustrating experience. Having no other choice, I called the help line. This time ""the wait-time was 47 minutes"".

Looking at the receipt it says every single grocery item was ""refunded"" with no substitutions. I had potential substitutions listed for every item in my cart, just in case due to the times we are in now. Although it was all supposedly ""refunded"" my order status says delivered, plus the service charge, with zero groceries. So now, during an already stressful time, I am out $260 and have no groceries. Which means that I can't buy groceries with money I now don't have.

No kidding?! Another hour and a half later I got another text simply saying ""it may not"" arrive that night at all. All texts were from King Soopers, not Instacart. The last one told me to go onto my account to change the delivery time or cancel the order completely. The app and browser wouldn't allow me to do so, so I did what that told me to do: contact King Soopers customer service. I spent an entire day on the phone with them and wow. The first person refused to even take my name and immediately transferred me to Instacart (this is the first time I heard that they were involved). Nobody answers the phones nor do they respond to emails. ALL I WANT is to CANCEL the damn order and get my money back. Instacart is not the company showing up on my credit card statement, King Soopers is. I never agreed to work with Insta and if I had known I wouldn't have done it. The second time I got to a real person with King Soopers I was told that if she canceled my order I wouldn't get my money back and that she couldn't cancel it anyway, it had to be through Instacart, bla bla bla, after I had just nicely explained that I tried to go that way and that my problem is with them, not Instacart. I asked to speak to her boss and what does she do? Transfers me right back to Instacart. Apparently they're going on strike on Monday. I've reported King Soopers to the BBB, sent more emails than I can count at this point, and my next step will be going to my local store to convince the manager than they need to just give me my money back so I can take my business elsewhere. Pandemic or not, it doesn't take over six days for them to simply communicate, cancel my order, and give me a refund. And the ""first delivery is free?"" Nope.

It didn't take me long to pick up on a pattern. If a woman aged 25 or older is handling your order, you will get most of what you ordered with sensible substitutions. But if you see a young male handling your order you can expect lightning fast shopping, almost none of what you ordered, and generic replacements if you forget to say ""no replacements"" on an item. Granted, this could be a luck of the draw situation, and I'd need to order several more times to be sure, but at this point a pattern is already emerging. If a young male is doing your shopping be prepared to be annoyed and ripped off. I'll tell ya one thing though. Instacart has the data to determine the pattern, and if they want to keep their business going they might want to avoid hiring people that consistently produce negative results. $25.00 for delivery and tip is a lot to spend on a half-filled order, and people will get tired of it Iike I am now. I think I'm done with this service for the time being. If they really want this to grow they'll start allowing people to choose their shoppers. The one I had earlier this morning was awesome. She not only found most of my list, but even filled a special request for something not on the website that I knew was in the store. That's right, my morning order.

In addition to a few other items, ordered 10 cans each of three different canned goods, but the store had a limit of 4 cans for each type of canned good. The shopper did not make the appropriate adjustments, and I was charged for the additional 18 items (meaning I was charged $10 more than I should have been charged) on my final receipt. I reported an issue with my order in the app, and received an email stating ""someone will be in contact with you shortly""; no one has been in contact with me yet. I also attempted to contact Instacart both via the in-app chat option as well as over the phone 5 different times over the span of two days. I never received a reply via the two in-app chats I attempted; when I phoned the first time, I was on hold for an hour and a half and then my call was disconnected. The second time I called, I was on hold for 2 hours and again my call was disconnected. I then ""scheduled a time"" to have Instacart call me. When the call came in at the scheduled time, I was placed on hold; I was on hold for 45 minutes and, yet again, my call was disconnected. I have never encountered such poor service both in terms of the order itself and in terms of customer service. I understand that this is a difficult time and many delivery services are being pushed to their limits, but this degree of carelessness is unacceptable. I, at the very least, expected that when I scheduled a phone call, a representative would be available and ready to assist me. It's not the $10 that matter, it's the fact that Instacart's service, in my experience, is entirely unreliable. If an order cannot be fulfilled correctly, AND there is no means of rectifying the issue, what exactly is the point of this service? I find this especially frustrating at a time like this, when people have limited options and limited funds. My experience with Instacart has been an absolute disaster, and I will neither be utilizing the service again nor recommending the service to others. If I could give my experience with Instacart a rating below zero, I would."

I requested again via chat that the shopper drop the groceries off at the new air taxi (there was no other option at this point) and noted I would give her a nice tip, she actually had the nerve to ask what her tip would be, which I did not respond to, and then shortly thereafter I got a notification that my order was complete and en route.

We waited up pat 10 for them. They were not delivered and no one called! Today is March 26.  We have been on hold for HOURS with Instacart. Fry’s takes no responsibility for the groceries purchased at their store. They have a two word answer for anything you ask— call Instacart. I told the store manager it was their store and he said, “No. It’s Instacart. They advertise grocery delivery but tell customers they can do nothing when you don’t get your groceries."

Instacart delayed the order by 5 hours on the day, and then ultimately cancelled... AT 10 PM! My mom was waiting up the whole time. No one called to explain anything to her or help her reschedule or even to tell her the order was cancelled. She just went to bed. I scheduled a call for customer service to call me and sort this out, no one called. I tried calling customer service- the app said it would be a 35 minute wait time. After 2 hours on hold I gave up. My mom still doesn't have her groceries and there are no available rebooking slots. DO NOT DEPEND ON THIS COMPANY FOR GROCERIES. APPALLING SERVICE, INSTACART. ABSOLUTELY APPALLING.

Instacart kept showing me in the app that somebody is shopping the groceries. Then it started delaying the delivery time every half an hour. Finally, I got the email and text my groceries will be delivered by 5:30 pm. I did not receive the delivery at that time.  Then two hours later, I received an email to reschedule the order. I tried to do that but now the app shows no delivery time available. Then I tried the next day and found a delivery time for a week later. I rescheduled it. But I checked Instacart App and website and I cannot see the updated delivery time. I emailed them but I did not receive a response even after two days. I tried to call them and waited for hours in the queue but no response. Also, my card was charged. I understand that stores might be running out of stuff, but in this case, I would like to get the update as they actually promise.  I also understand if they do not have enough shoppers, but in that case, they should not have accepted my order or have given me a timeline according to the availability.  They could have clearly managed this situation better. I do not see the updated delivery time even after I rescheduled the order. At least show the updated delivery time on the app in your account.

Three out of the four times I’ve ordered from this company they’ve screwed it up. The first one was a doozy. I bought over $400 worth of groceries and had them delivered but with no receipt. When I needed to return an item the next morning,Costco could find no history of the purchase in my membership account. I showed them the picture of the driver and my Insta cart/Costco purchase confirmation.  We both realized the shopper didn’t use my Costco membership at all. She used her own that she had just recently set up. I was not going to get any of my shopper rewards. I finally wound up on the phone with Costco Corp. and Instacart in a conference call. Instacart fell all over themselves with apologies. Costco ended up making it right by crediting me those purchase points. Instacart gave me a $30 voucher for “free delivery”. What a time consuming hassle the ordeal was. Also, I get that Instacart needs to bump up the price a bit ( Costco told me on one order of it was over $150 Instacart wanted to charge me) but when their drivers are adding things in the cart for themselves,that is thievery. Also they never want to leave a receipt. I am guessing this is because all the items they’ve put on your card will show up on your receipt but not on your doorstep. I’d give them zero stars if that were an option. I love Costco but I will never use Instacart to shop again."

So at 9:30 a.m. I went on line registered for Superstore on line shopping then I was told since I wanted my order delivered I had to register with instacart, which I did.  Then I went back to S.Store clicked on ""order to be delivered by instacart"" & scrolled down until I found a delivery time of next Tuesday (a week away) I figured, well that's just the way it is. Then I began my shopping.  now I am not the most savvy person on a computer, so it took me all morning & most of the afternoon to figure out how to get my usual products that I normally buy.  When I was finished my shopping I went to check out my cart  & was prompted to select a pick-up time.  I immediately knew this was wrong as I had already selected a delivery time, so I phoned Superstore on their contact number.  I was on hold for 41 minutes until an rep answered.  He informed me that I have the wrong extension, but he would connect me to the proper one. I was put on hold for another 17 minutes, only find out from this rep that Superstore has nothing to do with instacart & that I would have to call their 1-888 number, which I did.....I got put on hold again.   A voice told me my wait time was 51 minutes, not too happy but I waited what else could I do.  I had an order on my computer screen that I could not finish with out starting all over again. At the 31 minute mark the voice came on overriding the hold music informing me that me wait time is now 43 minutes..So I wait..At the one hour mark of waiting I was informed that my wait time is now 51 minutes again.  This continued for the next hour every time I would get close to the end of my wait time I was informed that I would wait even more.  Finally at 2 hours & 11 minutes a voice came on to inform me that my wait time is 14 minutes...finally I though..It's gonna be over soon...Three minutes & several seconds later there was a click the music stopped & I got a busy signal.  I very loudly cursed instacart several times while I frantically keep clicking the connect button on my phone.  This only receive a dial tone. If I had any other choice of getting my groceries, I would inform instacart where they could shove their delivery & customer service.  I know everyone is so busy with the virus scare & that everyone has to take precautions as well..but why does Instacart not install a ""Call you back at this number"" service when the know they have people on hold for such long periods.  It is now 8:23 pm & I still haven't ordered my groceries..BAD BAD BAD SERVICE Those people who are unable to pick up their food due to mobility problems should have some sort of priority sequence over those that are just panicking...but in this age of.......

I've purchased the item there before but Wegmans began to reduce the availability and began featuring their brand more prominently. I saw the 18 oz bag on the Wegmans site. Added the bags to the cart. The order was placed but during the processing I was informed they were not available. A substitute was offered by was too high in sodium. I text the shopper ""No substitute"" but he said he was done and on his way. I repeated I did not want them. He ignored my text. He showed up with the chips. I explained I did not want the order.  He flippantly explained We did not select no substitute button,  which I did select. Very bad experience. If you try this understand if you see the product it probably won't be available in store.

HOWEVER, the delivery got later, and then a number of texts to order more, and then more texts that one item was being cut, and then another.  1) Well, what showed up at my doorstep was ONLY ONE BOTTLE OF WATER (for which I did NOT receive a text that all 10 were not coming or I would have CANCELLED my order) as it was clearly not worth it for one bottle and 1 bunch of bananas!!!!!  MOREOVER, I have things to do during the day and cannot always look at the (incessant) texts that came regarding my order--and as I review them now NONE SAID ONLY ONE BOTTLE OF DISTILLED WATER WAS COMING.  NEVER.   IS THIS THE FAULT OF THE DRIVER WHO DID NOT READ THE ORDER CORRECTLY AND GRABED ONE AND NOT TEN???? OR THE FAULT OF THE SHOPPER THAT DID NOT TEXT ME TO LET ME KNOW IN TIME SO I COULD HAVE CANCELLED2) the ""review your order"" where you can ""see what was delivered"" makes it look like those other two items that were cut were in the order and on my doorstep -- WHICH THEY ARE NOT.3) I can no longer rate the driver--so if I find out it is his error or not the window has past within what seems to be left that ½ hour.4) I am waiting on hold for ""more that 69 minutes"" to talk to a live person in customer service.  We will see how that will go.5) It is not even clear to me that I got refunded for the 9 missing water bottles as they did not show up on the texts as being cut and therefore being refunded like the other two items were!!6) I also doubt I got refunded the extra $$ for the ""heavy load"" (which would have been 10 gallons of water...and turned out only to gee one gallon)The concept is a good one--especially at this time--the execution sucks at all level of the process."

Convenient, yes but I will NEVER ORDER FROM INSTACART AGAIN.  My initial order totaled $71 bucks. Later, they sent a text stating they had to replace two items but failed to say that the replacement items would be more than DOUBLE THE ORIGINAL COST, and one of the items should've been BOGO as advertised in the weekly flyer.  In this notification, I was not given the option of declining the expensive replacements.  MY TOTAL ORDER WENT FROM $71 to $114. This feels a lot like price gouging.  NEVER, EVER AGAIN !!!  When I've placed online/pickup orders with Kroger and they've had to replace an item, they replaced it at the same cost of the original item. After pickup, Instacart asked for a review so I left one. They said they'd get in touch with me...still waiting."

My order was placed and about one hour later we received a text that our order was delivered??? It was never delivered! Need a search warrant to find CS and then when we did it was a 59 minute wait time. Never received another text from the driver or from the store. After waiting all day and until about 6:00PM, we called our cc company to cancel the charge...the agent said she could see the charge was reversed. So this was the only way we knew our order was cancelled. Again no such text or email received that the order was cancelled and it still shows as delivered today 03/22/2020.   Instcart app and website is useless and also very disappointed with Aldi's since there is no way to call the store, no phone numbers anywhere."

I ordered BECAUSE we are in the midst of the Corona virus epidemic and I was trying to stay safe and away from people in the stores.  Granted, this is a crazy time for all so I would keep that in some perspective.  But I found the  app to be confusing to start and wasn't sure how to edit or update my order.  So I sent an email and was happy that they said someone would get back to me within 2 hours.  However, about 6 hours later I got a notice saying communication demands were particularly high and they'd still be getting back to me!  Well that was 3 days ago!  Since then I figured out how to edit my order.  As I was about to leave for my scheduled pick up (between 3-4 PM), I got a text at 2:20 PM saying that ""due to high volume"" it would be delayed and they'd let me know when.  Well I never heard from them again so I drove over at 4:30.  I sat in the pick up area for 15 minutes trying to figure out how to let anyone know we were there.  Finally my partner went inside and an Instacart worker came out (and couldn't manage to remember there was a social distancing mandate in place) and let us know that she couldn't find us on the schedule.  She offered to go inside and talk to a manager and text me.  Which she did, saying that no-one had begun to do my order yet (which was submitted THREE days prior) and did I wish to cancel it.  I texted back that I would not like to cancel it but would very much like to know AT LEAST approximately when it would be ready.  She didn't answer and so about 30 minutes later I went back to the (Sprouts) store to talk to her directly and shop myself if she still couldn't tell me anything.  I had to go inside (defeating the purpose of my ordering in the first place) and find her and politely ask her about my follow up.  I asked if there were any order to how they put the orders together since I had ordered 3 days ago.  She simply said that her manager informed her that I would get it but it might not be today!  She asked if I'd like to cancel it (again) and I (thought: A#@#*) but said:  YES!  That was it, no follow up with anyone.  I will NEVER use Instacart again.Oh I saw someone sayon the reviews they were told the wait to speak someone was 59 minutes.  So that is clearly a recording that never changes.  I heard that exact number the TWO times I tried to call!"

I tried to cancel my order both on the Wegman’s app and on an Instacart app. The presented an error message that there was no order associated with my account and that I should call customer support.The Instacart wait time to speak to a rep was estimated  at 33 minutes and estimated to be 59 minutes for an online chat or wait 2.5 hours for a callback. I chose a call back. The rep who called found my order and said it could be canceled but that it would take from 24 hours to three days to process the credit.

They show stores on their list that you cannot order from and you don't find this out until after spending the time picking items and adding them to the cart. Then, you re-enter all of your items AGAIN with another store and find out (at the end of the process) that the delivery date is 5 days away! After knowing (this morning) the delivery wouldn't be until Thursday, I tried to change 1 item in the cart which then eliminated any delivery options - including Thursday. Would not let me pick a delivery date. I was placing an order for my mother who is homebound in NY so you can imagine how stressed and hopeless this made me feel. I refreshed the screen multiple times, and there were no delivery date options available. Oddly enough, about 30 minutes later a new option appeared: 'Delivery within 5 hours' for another $4.00 charge. How is that possible when the system told me it would be Thursday, and then no delivery date options at all?! Out of desperation, I chose this option. Similar to another reviewer, I tried calling this horrible company, and the recording said it would be a 59 minute wait to speak to customer service. After waiting for 20 minutes, the recording said it would be a 45 minute wait. After an hour plus, the recording said it would be another 27 minutes. This service is not worth the stress and anxiety it causes - the system is not at all reliable. I will search for other options."

I wanted to try out Instacart to get some essential items from Aldi and do my part with social distancing.  Ordering was not an issue, however, I thought it was a little long for my order to take three days to be delivered.  I could wait, so I ordered.  On 3/19/20, I was working from home, in my living room, with the front door open and complete view of my front porch.  At 12:45 p.m. I got an alert that said my order was delivered.  No one had approached the porch, so I checked and there was nothing outside.  Next, I went to chat support about my missing order.  It said it would be a 54 minute wait.  I waited since I was working. However, after 2 hours of waiting, I didn't get a response so I ended the chat.  I sent three emails which said I would get a response within 2 hours and I have yet to receive a response, three days later.  I finally had a customer service rep call me.  She said my order would be refunded and I would have a $10 credit on my account.  My account has not be refunded and I did not receive a $10 credit.  Now, essential items I needed (milk, eggs, rice, crackers, frozen broccoli) are out of stock on the Aldi app.  I am beyond frustrated and upset with the way I've been treated and the lack of customer service.

I ordered my groceries at 2:00 pm, it told me I'd receive my groceries within 5 hours. Great, no problem. I then got an email that my order would be delayed. And then another. And then another. And then another. And then it said it would be delivered at 10:30pm. My grocery store of choice closed at 10. Finally, at 8:30, I got an email saying to reschedule my groceries because they would not be able to deliver today. I went into the app to reschedule for tomorrow, already incredibly frustrated, upset, and hungry, and it says there are no times available for the next 3 WEEKS. I finally had to cancel my order. I canceled it, and the app gave me NO indication as to whether my money would be refunded, as to whether or not I could report an issue or get any help, nothing. I reached out to customer support via email two hours ago, and have gotten no response. I sent another email just now, and it said I would get a response in 2 hours. A blatant lie, obviously. I called their support number and have been on hold for 20 minutes and am still waiting. I went to the website to see if there is a chat option, and it says there is a chat option in the app. There is no help option in the app and certainly no chat option in the app. I've been waiting all day for food that was never going to come, and there's no assistance to help me make this right. I live in a dorm room with no food. I am out of work. I spent nearly the last of my money on this. Also, the TOTAL came out to $85 and I was charged $130. This is f----g insane. Absolutely f----g insane. This is straight-up the WORST service I have ever used in my life.

I want to let all our customers know that when we are replacing items if you don’t recommend a replacement instacart comes up with those replacements so yes sometimes they recommend items that either cost more/less than the items you requested or items that are in no relation to what you ordered. So its up to that shoppers best judgment or to just refund your item. This past week I have been doing orders but unfortunately none of my customers orders can be fulfilled due to items being out of stock due to all the panic buying and stores not being able to keep up. So today after 2 hours of being on hold to get one of my customers order cancelled they deactivated my account claiming “Fraudulent” activity. First off I always speak to my customers to offer them the option to have their order cancelled/rescheduled especially due to the recent craziness. Which means I’m spending anywhere from 1.5 hours or more on the phone or in chat waiting to hear from an agent. Which then prevents me from moving on doing more orders so I’m missing money. For them to deactivate my account at the worst possible time is BS and the fact they didn’t even care enough to reach out before then. I have a 4.98 rating with over 250 deliveries and this is how i get treated as a worker. On top of risking the health of myself and my family by still trying to go out to deliver groceries to those who can’t shop for themselves or choosing to self quarantine. I demand answers !

The second item she texted me and said she was replacing it with an item that wasn't even close to what I was asking for and it cost almost twice what I wanted. I asked for a 4 lb bag of dry dog food and she was replacing it with a 10 oz can of wet dog food that was so expensive it was unbelievable. I texted back no no no but apparently she was already on her way. I never even got the items delivered!!   No one knew where she went or what happened. I called instacart and they were rude as hell. Told me I could get a refund in 15 days. I'm low income and I said that is unacceptable and I will file a bank fraud charge with my bank for your charges. Next day I had my refund in my bank.

HOPE YOU CAN READ ALL THE REVIEWS HERE BEFORE YOU ALSO FALL PREY TO THIS DISHONEST SERVICE I placed my very first order on Monday the 16th, wanting to try it out hoping it would be less stressful for the grocery stores due to the recent outbreak. I pushed the delivery out to Thursday, March 19th between 4-6 pm, one because it wasn't any items I needed desperately, and two because I wanted to give it enough time for restocking. I received about 12 emails from 345pm on staying order was running late and with each email, a later and later delivery time was provided. I wasn't too worried about that. Then, it all went to crap.Several things went bad. My order was incorrectly shopped for/purchased by driver even after I specifically notated in account -NO REPLACEMENT IF ITEM NOT AVAILABLE- I ordered a particular set of tortillas, which I received a COMPLETELY Incorrect, yet MORE EXPENSIVE bag that were marked as *correct* item found, and they are not the item I requested AT ALL, and to make it worse, I find it very DISHONEST that the Food for less receipt the delivery person provided in my bag reflects a purchase for $12.98 for a 12 bottle Dasani water ( which btw, was incorrectly substituted without approval, when I ordered Niagara water 35 bottle/case which costs $3.78/35, geez how convenient is that!!) however in the instacart website, I was charged $24 98. What happened to the $12.00 change difference from that cheaper purchase in store that the driver didn't adjust/refund me?!! Also, why were items I ordered like iceberg lettuce, and laughing cow cheese and toothpaste, not picked up, yet the driver notated ""customer changed mind"" in my order notes under said items.  I went back to food 4 less soon after this crap order arrived, mostly to check the status of their stock and livid, after speaking with an employee who affirmed these are available, because I was curious and wanting to return, I saw with my own 2 eyes the produce items were in store, sitting pretty in their designated spots. Does this kid Nicholas not know what lettuce looks like?! Why were these products not fulfilled?!!?? This is downright dishonest and upsetting to say the least!!! Not only did I get charged 200% more for items that are reflecting to be cheaper in my paper receipt, but I also can't get anyone to speak with over the phone.

The worst thing is the driver Bernadette keeps picking up other instacarts deliveries before delivering mine which they have had ready for over 3 hours as it shows shopped. Finally the order is in transit and on the map you see Bernadette drive 2 towns AWAY from me so then the order gets out of transit and back in the completed shopping status. Bernadette attempts to chat with me while doing this saying “problem with cart can’t pay” yet the order has been completed hours ago and IN TRANSIT for delivery multiple times so this driver is lying to continue shopping other orders instead of delivering mine. I have been attempting to chat with instacart requesting a refund and to cancel for 2 hours and no response. Instacart is a joke with some truly terrible employees. A 2 hour window shouldn’t be over 5 hours with out any kind of communication or acknowledgement and I definitely shouldn’t watch my in transit order drive 2 towns away from me when the order was status was in transit.

Albertsons manager was very pleasant kind and understanding, they explained they were not affiliated with instacart, that Instagram is 3rd party. Instacart double charged me $210.00, and only delivered half my order. 1 Item that I was charged for were missing.. I tried to call & chat with Instacart and they said they were having higher than normal call &  chat problems. Of course I did not get toilet paper, the most important thing I wanted. I also revoked my tip when I went to their web site, they ask for rating... At that screen I could elect to give bigger top of no tip, I picked no tip because my missing item that I was charged for was same among as tip... I figured it was even Steven revoking her top since there was no way to reach her and she did not ready out to me before, during or after the fact. I tried to submit online form to let them know I had several problems and their online form submit button would not work. It said I would be contacted via email with in 2 hours if the button worked but I guess it did not work bc I never got a email response. They did refund the proper amount from the $210.00, my bill was around $89.00, two days later I got the overage amount, I'm still waiting for refund of tip and refund of missing item totaling $13.00...

I know he didn’t believe me by the way he respond to my arguments .. he told me several times that driver said that he did deliver the order and that he gave it to me .. le me mention that my house has a gate that is locked and in order for the order to be deliver I have to open the gate with a key so i didn’t say anything else and I hang up the phone.. I decide to look my camera to see if anyone has stopped at my house just to make sure and guess what the driver did stopped at my home but he didn’t deliver my order ..he stopped and dropped off a bag with a box off sandwich bag that I never order and all the food I order when to someone else not to me and they charge my credit card $165 dollars for a box or 48 sandwich bag ? Who in the right mind will use this delivery service to order just a box off sandwich bag ? Were my food go ? I don’t think that this was a mistake .. he had the right address ..I will never ever use this service again ..Customer service is the worse they say that they have a 24/7 service and you have to wait on the phone for 2:05 minutes an none picks up ?

Two experiences with Instacart militated for my second review. With the reviewer who wishes that s/he could give zero stars, I agree.I recently had surgery on one foot (to be followed up by the same procedure on the other foot) and have been homebound for 5 weeks. The supplies I put in prior to the surgery finally ran out and I decided to try Instacart: how perfect it seemed, to have someone shop and deliver my groceries when I could not leave my home. Shop #1 was a disappointment because the shopper made substitutions for items for which no substitution was necessary. Shop #2 was a disaster to put it mildly. The shopping did not take place as scheduled by me; items were simply dropped from the list; substitutions were again made for items for which a substitution was unnecessary; and the substitutions clearly seem to have been made for the convenience of the Instacart shopper: if s/he did not recognize my item, it seems clear that the shopper chose something close to it.In addition, I placed my Shop #2 order on a Wednesday. I watched as, daily, the pick-up date was pushed forward by one day. I finally received my Wednesday order the following Monday - 5 days later than when I needed it!I want also to note that the ""customer service"" at Instacart is very nearly non-existent. Of the four different customer service representatives I had to speak to in order to get my Shop #2 released, not one was especially pleasant to deal with. The fourth individual would profit from a course in customer relations: allow the customer to explain the problem; what has been done to rectify it if anything; and speak to the customer with respect. The woman who spoke to me was edgy, borderline defiant, and downright sarcastic.I am sure there are really effective shopping / delivery services out there. Sadly, Instacart apparently is not one. Infuriating, simply infuriating."

The concept is GREAT the execution is HORRIBLE. Instacart is not a cheap service.  You are tipping, paying premium prices for products, a service fee and a delivery fee.  My first order went smoothly and I thought, ""This is going to be a great relationship!"".  From there, it went downhill.  I've had hundreds of dollars of groceries left outside my house unattended an hour prior to scheduled drop off (and me not home).  I've had groceries show up an hour later than the scheduled drop off.  The one constant, is the lack of consistency in getting what I order.  It's AMAZING how every shopper never gets the order right.  My most recent order I was billed for an item that should have been twice the size than the item I actually received and the shopper thought a replacement that cost THREE TIMES MORE was a good idea.  Infact, that ONE item totalled by itself half my bill!  Then had the audacity to say they couldn't get half my items because you know, coronavirus (apparently sweet potatoes and coffee cream are hot pandemic commodities). Instacarts solution?  Credit me $4.77!  What an insult! If you don't mind not knowing when your groceries will show up, never getting the items you requested, being billed for items you didn't receive and leaving your list in the hands of someone who probably still has their mom buying their groceries, instacart would be a great fit for you. I have now opted to go with either grocery gateway or metro.  The downside is the aren't available to deliver in 2 hours, but the last few times I used their service, my products were spot on, quality and delivered on time."

I never asked someone to change my order date and time again. Customer service was nice, but extremely terrible and passive aggressive with a nice creepy lying attitude. Supervisors and associates told me different information and did things to my order I never asked them to do. REALLY REALLY BAD. Other times I've had bad experiences, but not this bad! I just canceled the order because Supervisor told me not to change the date for tomorrow in hopes the order could still be delivered in 24 hours. At around 8:30 the company now changed my order to Saturday. So order placed on Wednesday and now they were trying to deliver my order Saturday, even though my roommate placed an order for the same store and same address on same day and received order three hours later. Customer service seemed like they were just laughing and passively aggressively just saying and doing whatever. No solution except push back my order another 48 hours. Wednesday to Thursday and then Thursday to Saturday. I'm going tomorrow myself and getting my groceries. I'll probably try to avoid using InstaCart, though it is a convenience. Hopefully there is a competition company, so they don't try to do what they did to me today.

Instacart expects too much from people who work with them and they pay us like we are one of there own employees we pay all our bills and taxes and insurance is on us so be aware o this come to an understanding that the less u pay the less times shopper will want to spend on the store so more than likely a shopper will refund an item if it’s hard to find and their not getting payed much.I really do apologize for all the bad experiences you all have had but a lot of times when u order large you shouldn’t expect much from a regular grocery store there items are limited 2 or 3 items should be ordered at most from grocery stores anything beyond this try sams club,cosco or bjs or any other places that carry items in bulk because retail grocery store are not where it’s at.

Great service. So, I thought I would try it with my local New Hampshire Shaws Supermarket. I ordered on Monday, early afternoon. I was given a 4-6pm window, but had to go out at 6pm so, erring on the side of caution, opted for the next day 3-4pm. At about 3:30, I got a text to say they were running late and it would be 4:15-4:45. At 5:30, I finally called customer service, and a shopper had not even been assigned yet. This reflects extremely poorly on Instacart, but also on Shaws. They should not be associated with such a bad company."

Wathen,1 star: Bad,BAD EXPERIENCE,"The first time I shopped Instacart (Kroger: Columbus, Mississippi) was two weeks ago, and that was a great experience. As it turns out, it was only by chance that my order was placed with a very responsive shopper who completed and delivered the order to my dad in the desired time frame. Unfortunately, I have tried ordering 2 times since then only to be very disappointed. One shopper completed my entire order just to disappear with it and never showed up, requiring a time-consuming call to customer service. Although they reassigned the order to a different shopper that evening, she charged me for more expensive items but delivered less expensive items, which required yet another call to customer service. Today was my last time trying to use Instacart in Columbus, Mississippi. My order was placed and then received, but never a response from the shopper. Again, this led to another call to customer service. I asked if they could just assign my order to Ashley, the shopper from my initial experience, but that was not possible. I cancelled the order, but it may take up to 10 days for my account to be credited! I hope this company succeeds, but they have a lot of improvements to make."

I call Instacart and they tell me the person has car trouble and rescheduled my grocery delivery for tomorrow. Unacceptable. I asked for a refund.

The service was not just bad it was terrible. My husband and I placed an order, one of the items was a fresh whole chicken, the shopper had advised that Loblaws (a huge grocery store) was all out of fresh chicken, when we had told the shopper that we had called Loblaws and they had told us otherwise, all of a sudden the shopper said ""Oh yes, found some."" We had been waiting for our order for over 3 hours, just to find out the shopper had cancelled our order and someone brand new was shopping for us now. DO NOT waste your time shopping with Instacart. You are better off, going to the grocery store on your own. At least then you will know that the right items are selected and you will get them quickly."

She even had the audacity to ask me for a cash tip after she knows I tipped her on the app. After spending over an hour on the phone with Kroger they told me all they could do was give me a $30 credit. Now I have to wait for someone to hopefully call me back and upper management. This woman spent my money on her groceries and the only thing Kroger wanted to do was give me a discount on my order that didn't even equal the amount she spent.

Well that has changed.  I've noticed rather minor discrepancies lately, but today confirmed it:  Instacart is a shoddy operation bordering on fraudulent.  The events that occurred today were complicated to explain.  I've tried to summarize them here:1.  I PLACED AN ORDER HOURS AGO, AT APPROXIMATELY 6 PM CST.  BEFORE I WAS FINISHED, THE ORDER WAS CLOSED, AND MY CREDIT CARD CHARGED WHILE I STILL WAS SHOPPING.3.  MEANWHILE, THE HAD ALLEGEDLY CHECKED OUT, AND I WAS TOLD (through yet another text) NO CHANGES COULD BE MADE TO THE ORDER.  I WAS DENIED A CHANCE TO REVIEW MY ORDER/2. THEN  A CONTRADICTORY  MESSAGE PINGED MY PHONE WHICH STATED THAT I STILL HAD TIME TO ADD ITEMS.  I ATTEMPTED TO DO SO, BUT THOSE ITEMS WENT TO A DIFFERENT CART.  I WAS CHARGED, AND THE THE GROCERIES WERE PROMPTLY DELIVERED BY YET ANOTHER SHOPPER.AT ABOUT 6:30 PM..3. SO WHERE DID THE FIRST SHOPPER GO WITH MY GROCERIES???4.  MY PHONE HAS BEEN BLOWING UP WITH SMS MESSAGES ALL EVENING, AT LEAST 30.AT 7:19 PM  ANTANIKA ""STARTED SHOPPING"" ACCORDING TO AN SMS MESSAGE.  5.  ANTANIKA TEXTED ME AT 7:50 P.M. TO SAY THAT ""THEY"" WANTED ME TO APPROVE A CHANGE SHE MADE.  THERE WAS NO PLACE TO APPROVE A CHANGE ON THE APP AT THAT TIME.  NORMALLY THERE IS.   SO I TEXTED HER RIGHT BACK AND SAID NO, I DO NOT WANT DRIED CRANBERRIES. (Originally, I'd ordered dried cherries.)  SHE RECEIVED MY ANSWER WITHIN SECONDS.HER RESPONSE TO ME ""I CHECKED OUT ALREADY"".WHAT!?!?  WHY DID SHE BOTHER ASKING?5.  STILL NO GROCERIES ARRIVED, AND THERE WAS NO MAP TO VIEW ON THE APP, AGAIN, AS USUALLY YOU CAN TRACK THE DRIVER EN ROUTE.  NOTHING. 8. 8:46 PM, I RECEIVE YET ANOTHER SMS MESSAGE.  ""BRYAN F"" IS SHOPPING YOUR ORDER""  WHAT THE HELL?  WHERE WAS ANTANIKA AND THE SECOND (technically the third) CHECKED OUT ORDER?7.   MORE MESSAGES FOLLOWED.  9:07 PM  ""BRYAN F""  REPLACED JIF CREAMY PEANUT BUTTER"".  WITH WHAT??? AND WHY IS ""BRYAN F"" SHOPPING MY ORDER AGAIN.  THAT MADE A TOTAL OF THREE SHOPPERS, NOT INCLUDING THE LADY WHO SHOPPED THE ADDED ITEMS.IT IS NOW 9:30 P.M., AS OF THIS WRITING..  I AM HUNGRY..  I HAVE THE FLU.  MY PETS ARE STARVING.  WHERE ARE MY BLOODY GROCERIES?????I HAVE SCREENSHOTS OF EVERYTHING, AND i WILL MOST DEFINITELY REPORT THE INCIDENT TO MY BANK TOMORROW.  THREE PEOPLE CHECKED OUT MY ORDER, AND I WILL DEMAND THAT ANY EXCESSIVE CHARGES BE REVERSED.  THIS IS FRAUD, AND IF FORCED TO, I WILL TAKE IT TO THE NEXT STEP, THOUGH I SUSPECT MY BANK WILL INVESTIGATE THE INCIDENT..EDITED TO ADD:  ""BRYAN f"" FINALLY SHOWED UP AT ABOUT 10:00 P.M.  I HAD SHUT OFF THE PORCH LIGHT AND LIVING ROOM LAMPS, AND WAS DETERMINED NOT ACCEPT THE ORDER.  BUT WITH FOUR PAIRS OF SAD, HUNGRY EYES STARING BACK AT ME, I FINALLY RELENTED.  BESIDES, I WAS AFRAID THAT HE MIGHT DUMP THEM AND LEAVE, ANYWAY.  I  EXPRESSED MY ANGER, AND STATED THAT SHOULDN'T EXPECT A TIP.  HE SAID THAT ANTANIKA HAD AN EMERGENCY,  SUDDENLY?  AFTER SHE TOLD ME SHE HAD COMPLETED CHECKING OUT?  i WASN'T THERE SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT TRANSPIRED..  PERHAPS SHE WAS SICK, OR HAD A FAMILY EMERGENCY.. IN THAT CASE, HOWEVER,, A SUPERVISOR SHOULD HAVE INFORMED ME PROMPTLY, AND MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO HAVE THE GROCERIES DELIVERED ASAP..  WHY DID ""BRYAN f"" HAVE TO SHOP MY ORDER ALL OVER AGAIN?  FOR THE THIRD TIME?  I WAS INCLINED TO GIVE ""BRYAN F"" THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT, BUT AS HE WALKED AWAY, HE YELLED INSULTING WORDS BACK AT ME.  SO PFFT!  NO SOUP FOR HIM.  FOR THE RECORD, I LODGED A COMPLAINT ON INSTACART'S WEBSITE HOURS AGO, INCLUDING MY PHONE NUMBER AND EMAIL ADDRESS.  THE SITE STATES THAT COMPLAINTS WILL BE ADDRESSED VIA A PHONE CALL WITHIN TWO HOURS..  I'M NOT HOLDING MY  BREATH.

https://ca.trustpilot.com/reviews/5e55381d3c93ae0bc409d5bd,Mona,1 star: Bad,Instacart is a terrible service.  Don’t use it.,"Instacart is a terrible service.  Don’t use it.  Dishonest, incompetent, don’t care about customers. Their business model seems to be:  Soak the customers for every penny, provide no customer service, lie, and get the orders done fast so who cares if they are always wrong.  Also charge their credit cards for more than the order is worth and take “seven business days” to return the money.They are guaranteed to mess up your order no matter what you do.  So you’ll have to go to the store yourself to get the remaining items or order them on Amazon (another delivery fee, even for Prime members).   It will take you more time, money, & effort than buying your own groceries at the store.I used to be a member, with “no delivery fee”, but instead they charged a “service fee”.  I’m no longer a member, but broke my wrist & live in a walk up building with no elevator. So they charged me a “driver tip”, a “delivery fee”, and a “shopper tip” (which I later reduced to zero, although the screwed up order was not entirely his fault).  So..about $16 in fees for a senior on a very tight budget.  Plus they charged my card $50 more than the order was worth, which will take them “7 business days” (nearly 2 weeks) to return.The shoppers are timed apparently. Which is how they make their 2 hour delivery windows.  So their priority is to get through in the shortest time possible, and they don’t care if they mess up your order.Here were my results from Fairway 86th Street, a store I know inside and out (better than most of the employees there). I had 24 items on my list.  The dishonest suggestion on the Fairway website was that your first delivery would be “free”!  Well in this day & age, “free” isn’t free.  I spent hours preparing the list, including suggested substitutes for each and every item.  The shopper may choose to ignore those anyway, as he only cares about his time window.  I would suggest taking a crucial step, which I forgot to do.  Take a screen shot of every screen on your list, as your original list will disappear after it is shopped.  This is probably deliberate.  Not that it will matter anyway, as you’ll be lucky to even get a $5 credit from Instacart’s laughably named “customer service”.So my results:  Lundberg short grain brown rice. Alternate suggested: Lundberg long grain brown rice. Refunded. Couldn’t find it.  Really?  No brown rice in the entire store?  There are bulk bins of brown rice in that store, but that would take too much time (and effort, and thought)Goya canned chick peas: 2. Suggested alternate:  diifferent brand. Refunded.  Shopper claimed there were no canned chick peas in entire store, sending a photo of 1 shelf to prove it.  I know that store.  They have stuff all over the place.  But shopper didn’t want to spend time & effort to look.Jarrow-Dophilus Probiotics.  Suggested alternate:  another Jarrow version.  Refunded.  I did have a more specific request for a vegetarian probiotic.  Likely there was another one in the store, but shopper didn’t want to spend time and effort to look.Italian roast coffee:  whole beans.  I got ground.Fairway peanut  butter: half a pound.  I got a pound.Honey:  one honey bear, golden honey.  I got 2. One golden, the other wildflower (the substitute suggested). This may have been my fault, but since I failed to screenshot the original list, & Instacart erases it, I couldn’t be sure.Other items: as requested, or substituted with acceptable substitutes.So assuming the honey was my mistake, I had five out of 24 items wrong.  That’s 79% of my original order.   Sadly, this is typical of my experience with Instacart.I ordered the rest on Amazon (another steep delivery fee, since I am a Prime member, but not a Pantry member).So if paying through the nose to get maybe 80% of your order correct appeals to you, by all means use Instacart.  Otherwise, avoid them like the plague.  If you must, screenshot your order before submitting."

They gave me a 4.44lb prepackaged thing of chicken wings with a Meijer tag saying the price was a little over $13.

Many times IC will combine your orders together with 75+ items to locate for 3 separate customers and then drive up to 30+miles to deliver to 3 separate customers.  It's a lot of mental work shopping for 3 people and having to text, replace, refund items not available.  They may pay is $16 for all of this.  NO one will take the order and it will sit up to an hour.  When, if they finally separate the triple order, they then offer it each one for $7.  Which again it will sit for another hour.  This is were most of your orders will sit.  Most orders can take up to 45 to drive to store, shop, checkout, load car and deliver.  After mileage expense a shopper makes $3 an hour.

That operator then got into my account and changed my phone number locking me out of the app.  When I finally got ahold of someone she apologized and fixed it.  The next day I was fired via email for swearing during a conversation with a hostile operator.  I called again and got a supervisor who said he could see my info and it said I was fired for missing items.  They send me an email from the trust and safety dept saying I am fired for swearing but then lie on my info and say I was fired for missing items.  The people working in the trust and safety dept can’t be trusted.  Shady as heck.  The operators can mess up your account if they get an attitude.  Anyone who works as a shopper for them knows the app is frustrating and the customers think just because they ordered it on the app it’s available.  The operators are helpful most of the time but they obviously have too much power if they don’t like what you said.  2 supervisors agreed that the operator who messed with my account locking me out temporarily should be fired.  But the trust and safety dept ignored that completely and lied about why they fired me.  Pathetic company.

When my son mention she was late she was rude, gave multiple excuses, one being she had two orders....I’m sorry but her inability to manage time and multitask shouldn’t end up being my problem. Maybe grocery shopping is too hard for her. Anyways and the cherry on the top was she had her children with her. I know this is not allowed by instacart.

Instacart is not consistent on keeping in touch with customers about items that aren't available or substitutions. Every driver is different and some offer much better service than others. I generally tip 20% or more and most of the shoppers and driver's do a good job. There just are a couple of drivers and shoppers that I wish hadn't been assigned to my orders.

I went with another company called SHIPT what a difference they SPECIFY what idles to find items so your not running around the store you can contact them and customers instantly I made 500.00 my first week I strongly recommend jumping ship they also send you quite frequently to target so easy to shop..Bye Bye INSTACART

Last delivery order I made, my groceries were left on someone else’s porch in a different Cul-de-sac, without the house owners being there. The ’leave it on porch’ selection was not selected. I thought maybe it was just a minor mess up so I tried delivery again. This order at least arrived in my cul-de-sac. However, instead of verifying the house number, the deliverer walked to each houses‘ front door and asked them if they had groceries being delivered. I had to walk to the other side of the cul-de-sac to flag her down and to get my groceries. Needless to say, Instacart services have gone downhill and will not be used by me again."

Don't they have to be halfway respectful and kind to get this job?? I have been using this service every week for over a year now for my disabled, elderly Mom. I always tip very well because I expect the shopper to communicate with me on replacements, etc. I always put on the notes that I need a careful shopper who will communicate with me--and I'm willing to compensate for this $$$$$. Lately, I'm getting more and more shoppers with attitude problems. If an item is missed or not replaced with something she is ok with--I still have to drive across town and bring it to her! Like I said... I am willing to tip VERY well for a shopper who will go above and beyond for me. I make it clear in the notes that I need a shopper who is willing to communicate with me during the order. So they have the choice not to take the order. Today, a shopper told me that 'he was doing me a favor and to watch how I talked to him.' Another shopper said... 'Lady, I don't have time for this. You'll have to just get that, yourself..'... **Ummm... Is this NOT a grocery delivery SERVICE?? Isn't DELIVERY and SERVICE the entire point? I'm looking for a replacement company as we speak.

However what happens is you’ll ask for five yogurts or a certain flavor and if they only have two the shoppers just get two. They don’t write and ask if you want another flavor or kind. I’d asked for pita chips and the guy probably didn’t even look in the right spot. He just grabbed Fritos. Didn’t write and ask if I wanted something specific. Fritos and pita chips are so far removed from each other. I saw and said I didn’t want them but it was too late. When he showed up after he said You can just get your money back.

This “confidential” information I should not have been aware of, was the very important fact that the receipt showed that my groceries tallied up to only 112.72!!! yet Instacart took an additional 20.31 on grocery charges, in addition to $5.99 for delivery fee, $6.65 tip & 6.65 for service fee = a whopping total of 39.60 for their services!!!!.  When I questioned why I was not honored the in-store prices paid by Instacart the rep had no problem placing the blame on Acme for offering these higher prices to support pricing variances within their stores and making it beyond their control.  When I told him I didn’t understand how Instacart could take the extra money for something they clearly paid less he said “I know I get a lot of calls about this and to tell you the truth I’m very confused too”.

It took some time to get the card and get my bags approved. I was looking forward to adding a new gig to my work schedule. I feel like I wasted my time with this company. They clearly want the shoppers to “ put all their eggs in one basket “ and only work for them. I remember the first time the schedule came out. All the slots were gone in seconds. I managed to get a short 1.5 hour slot only to realize it overlapped with the schedule I had for food delivery. I ended up not keeping it because the time was too short compared to the schedule I already had. The next week when the schedule came out I had even worse luck. I could not grab a time slot. So 2 weeks without working for them made them decide not to allow me to schedule any blocks the following week. I was directed by email to call a number. I did that and the woman I spoke to at Instacart was terribly rude and condescending. I explained the situation to her and voiced that I was disappointed to take all my time to get on with this company and there is not available work. They told me that they viewed me as being “Unreliable”. Oh please. Long story short. I never worked a minute for them. I could not get access to the schedule because they blocked me just for not accepting any work the first 2 weeks. And of course they just keep hiring. They want you to work 29 hours a week with them which I just did not have time for all that. Independent contractor jobs are a work when you want. I feel like they overstep those boundaries. And the customer service is atrocious. They need to learn to Communicate and be more understanding

Say the item is out of stock everywhere not in only one part of the site. Don't allow people to add it to their cart when they look these items up via the search engine. Also we pay a monthly fee for free delivery and Instacart tacks more fees on so what's the point of paying a monthly free delivery fee. Twice tonight I've had to call and complain. We received Ginger Ale instead of Mt Frost and received milk that expires tomorrow.

He said “your zip code?” Gave him my zip code. “Can I have your address or something?”I gave him all the information I could give him even though he seemed as if I was inconviencing him. So he told me that they only come out to “some rural areas”. That was the answer I got. I figured I’d call again because it seemed as if I was inconviencing this man and then an Indian women answered the phone.

Well, when I had my cart ready to submit, the $20 hadn't been automatically removed the way it was supposed to, so I contacted support. To their credit, they responded very quickly on a Sunday afternoon and verified the credit; they told me to go ahead with the order and they would refund me $20 if it didn't come off automatically. Well, not only did the $20 not get credited automatically, but the system is extremely dysfunctional when it comes to delivery time: my initial confirmation email showed in one place that the delivery time was 2-5 (which was what I'd selected) and in another place showed 10-12 (same email!). My second confirmation email said it would be delivered between 4 and 5. And then the shopper actually showed up shortly after 1:00! Good thing I was home anyway.

So we wait till they are forced to give a peak boost for someone to take it at 2 dollars more each time. This is why. We work out butts off and hardley break even. Then there are the orders for delivery with no tip plus even after delivering the food we still recieve no tip. Its not right. Your paying  for a service the least you can do is tip. A couple bucks? But no. It makes it hard to want to care about your order when we only recieve 9.00 for an hour of work. Please be more understanding of what we do for you.

The last stone was when I caught them charging me more than the actual prices at the store! I spoke with the guy who designed the whole grocery delivery app model and he told me they get 15% from the grocery store. On top of that I caught them marking up prices another on average 10% and then they were adding a $9.95 deliver fee, $2.87 wellness fee and automatically added $4.87 as a tip.

The delivery woman did not care to call on our phone number  nor made any attempt to ask the doorman to call us. She cancelled the order as soon as she hits the lobby. In her mind was she thinking that we would be waiting for 2 hrs in the lobby with a door man and a telecom service to inform the tenants, was unfathomable.  While we were waiting for the updates, we were shocked to realise that not only our order was cancelled but also Instacart levied a cancellation fee for $15 for no faults on us. The contact link that briefly appeared during the time when the delivery person was shopping and delivering (Instacart has to look into the dictionary and understand the meaning of the word) was terminated as soon as she cancelled the order. When I tried to address the grievances to the customer care, I found myself in another maze. No number to contact; only a convoluted mail system that was designed to leave no trace of complaints. The next day the customer care justified that the delivery was attempted at right time and the fee for our ‘no show’ can’t be revoked. Worst of all, they implicated that we were not in the apt during the delivery. This is not how my wife has envisioned her B’day celebration to be. Instacart has a very poor delivery mechanism and very poor customer service. The log of all events that happens during the delivery vanishes after the event leaving no clue to go back and retrieve this information in case of a complaint like mine.I, strongly, urge people to refrain from using Instacart and rather use conventional shopping ways to avoid unnecessary hassles and best of all, not being cheated."

So when you take into account the three hours she spent the Kroger plus the gas it took her to get there and then go to deliver the to order she picked up finally after 3 hours and the money she lost by not being able to work for those three hours it cost her dearly. Instacart reply was to throw $10 at her like she was a beggar on the street. She made a whopping $26 for the entire day half of it being wasted so she had a choice need to put the money back in the car so she could work the next day and lose more money or buy a loaf of bread and some bologna and cheese so that our family could eat that night because we had just spent $300 fixing a front axle on the vehicle so that she could do the shopping.

Umm, what, where will my groceries be for six hours?  Oh sorry, they will be there asap.  at 1:30, still not here, no sign anyone is shopping.  Customer service, after a 25 minute hold time, tells me the system is down and they have no idea if anyone is doing my order.  So the snow storm is coming, no food in my house and I can't leave because they could show up and leave food on my porch to rot for two days until I get back home, not to mention me having to show up at my friends house for the storm with no food.  Just deplorable. I will say the customer service people are super nice, as helpful as they can be.  I'd suggest they look for other work.  This company is a gong show."

After a friend highly recommended their service, I decided to try it for the very first time in Oldsmar, Florida (suburb of Tampa) when my family and I were traveling there on vacation and staying in a condo with a kitchen. Our flight was scheduled to arrive in mid-evening, so I thought it would be a great idea to have the week's groceries delivered that same evening so we'd have dinner ingredients pretty much right when we got there and breakfast ingredients for the next morning. When our plane landed, I received a text that the delivery would be delayed by an hour, which I was a bit disappointed about, but figured we would still be ok. The thing is THE GROCERIES NEVER SHOWED UP THAT NIGHT, and I had to reach out to Instacart because they never sent any more correspondence that evening even when the delivery was well past the scheduled arrival time. We ended up ordering a pizza to tide us over, setting us back an unanticipated $35. I reached out to Instacart, who said they'd deliver the order by noon the next morning, so we rearranged our entire next day to accommodate...and by 12:30pm WE STILL HAD NO GROCERIES. Finally I called and cancelled the entire order, we went out for lunch (because my family was starving! Spent another unanticipated $55!!!), and I wasted yet another 1.5 hours of our trip grocery shopping. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!!"

So I am very sick(terminal) and I had a lot of people coming to my home for Christmas dinner cause this might be my last! Almost all my order was changed in the store but the worst is my turkey!! I ordered a 9-11 pound bird for all of my guest. My driver sent me msgs about changing my order but not for my turkey. My bird was 50$ plus taxes and I got a 5-7/pound bird. Clearly not enough for all my guest. If my driver would have told me I would have gotten 2! When he showed up I was very upset and contacted the company after giving him a 20 tip. I asked about my refund and he said the company was aware and discount would be back in my bank. I got messaged them right away and several times in the days that past with no communication on their part. And of course my money never went back in my bank. Yesterday night(Monday the fixed I got a reply finally. Mercedes told me that my order was 1 week ago and I should have contacted them right away and basically it's my fault. She said she Will Not return my money 30$ plus tax but is willing to put a 25$ credit in my instacart app that I can use only after a 35$ or more purchase. My credit is also 10$/plus tax under what I should be reminded. I paid 50+ tax and my bird was 20 even plus my 20$ tip. And I'm going to get a 25$ credit? Aw no I don't think so. I am terminally ill and can't go out alone or I would have gone to the store myself. Even I left several msgs about my issue she started she would do nothing else because there is no proof they frauded me. Except I have my order receipt for what I paid and I have the receipt the man gave me. It clearly shows they owe me money that they pretty much told. Imagine they overcharge people 15$ each per 100/people or day, per week, per year. I say that's a pretty good profit. I made her very away I would call my lawyer in the morning and she doesn't care. Again she said my order is a week old and just because they are flooded with emails it took them longer to get to mine, Nd because it took them a week it's my fault and I will not be reimbursed. This company is disgusting doing this to a dying woman on her last Christmas with family and friends! You gave my guest an amazing memory if not feeding them properly.

Instacart gives access to a wide variety of shops which is a great idea.. the problem being... they charge a delivery fee for each different store. Or a yearly fee of $99 for free delivery but your order minimum is then $35. If you're like me, you would want to use the variety of shops to price check the items you wish to purchase. My shopping cart says each shop has a $10 minimum for free shipping and both subtotals from the two different shops are telling me I've qualified for free shipping. At check out it tells me one of my orders will actually include a $7.99 delivery fee and a $2-4 tip for the driver. On top of all that.. your items are NOT guaranteed to be available. The replacement options provided were all 2 or 3 time more expensive. Using instacart was a waste of time, and in the end it just felt like another scam. Amazon prime, for example, gives many perks to paying for the service and you can buy a wider variety of fairly priced goods."

I paid for a year of express and I have had items get permanently stuck in the cart preventing me from using instacart for a months time before it got fixed despite calling literally everyday for weeks. The website is unbelievably unintuitive, I often have to wait for a shopper to accept my order then message shoppers to make changes because the site barely functions 3/4 of the time and editing an order is harder than entering the military. Customer service is dedicated to kicking the can down the isle, no one can ever help you, everything needs to be escalated if they don't outright just repeat ""im sorry, im sorry"" with no solution offered. I have had a problem with this service pretty much every month and in the year using them have been offered a mere $10 credit twice in that entire time despite a major error from one shopper costing me hundreds of dollars, of which instacart was again, very slow to fix and I reported previously here.

I even had to call the store once to verify that a shopper was lying about an item that they removed and stated was not in stock. Shoppers don't read instructions and replace items when they were asked not to, etc - this has resulted in the last four times having to go to the store to fix the issue - which defeats the purpose of ordering delivery!! Today was the last straw - I added a few last minute items to an order and ended up spending more than I had planned. My card was declined, so I used my bank app to transfer more funds to my debit card. When I tried to again place the order, Instacart FROZE THE ORDER and now I cannot order my groceries.

About 3/4 of the orders have an issue with them, smashed/bad produce, items missing, arrives late, etc. When you call Instacart to correct the issue, it takes them a long time to correct it and sometimes they still don’t correct it. Placed two orders tonight on Instacart, one from HEB and one from Central Market. Central Market order came with a poor substitute for the coconut cream I ordered. HEB order was supposed to arrive by 2 p.m., but didn’t arrive until 5:49 p.m. and it was missing items and also had a poor substitute for an item. It was missing 2 bags of cherries that I ordered, and instead of having my Kellogg cereal that I ordered they delivered an off brand cereal. Called them. They were supposed to resend the 2 bags of cherries, the Kellogg cereal, and the coconut cream, and they were supposed to refund the money for these items and credit my account for the inconvenience. 2 hours later new delivery person shows up with 1 bag of cherries, NO cereal, and NO 2nd bag of cherries. Called Instacart again and was told no supervisor was available to speak with me. This is very poor customer service. The first supervisor I spoke with should’ve been on top my replacement order to make sure that one went right, but they did not stay on top of it and they dropped the ball in it because the “replacement” order was also messed up. I’m going to start looking for a different delivery service. When I first started with Instacart the issues were few and far between, but over the last year the issue have increased and have become very frequent."

I ordered from Omaha steaks last year avoiding Instacart and even left my phone number in case something negative happened so I could address it. Well they don’t call or address a shortage I ordered 8lbs and they got 3lbs.That was not enough. There is a high probability Instacart’s service will disappoint.

I wanted to get a look at my $60 Ribeye Roast and season it. I opened the fridge and the meat was still in the bag. I opened the bag and found that instead of a nice $60 cut of beef I received 2 $14 CHUCK roasts!!!  It was just about 1 am on Christmas morning and there was nothing I could do.

A little before 4pm, I received notification on the app that Rose was pulling my order, but when I looked at the app 30 minutes later, less than half the items had been pulled and Rose was no longer working on completing my order. Forty minutes later, an unknown person on the app was proceeding with processing my order, but then stopped. More time passes and then I get a notice via email that my order will now be an hour late, but would be still be arriving. Ninety minutes after my second delivery window passed, I got a call from the shopper saying that they cancelled my order because the store closed at 3pm, which is not true (store was closing at 7pm, not 3pm) and extremely inconvenient because at that late hour, I had no other options to buy our holiday meal from anywhere else, as every grocery store was closed by the time I got notice of the cancellation. My husband also missed three hours of work today, waiting for a delivery that never showed up. He lost wages waiting extended hours for this order to arrive. If the order was going to be cancelled, the notification should have been given much sooner to allow for alternate plans to be made and my husband would not have lost money by leaving work to wait for the delivery, but instead they began my order, then delayed my order, making us think it was still coming, only to cancel it almost three hours after my original delivery time. For my “convenience” the order was rescheduled for the day after Christmas, which is not convenient because I needed it in time for our holiday meal, so I had to cancel the order completely, leaving us with absolutely nothing for our family’s holiday dinner and no means to remedy the situation. To compensate me for the issue, I was offered a $10 credit, which doesn’t help my situation at all. After this extremely negative experience, I will never use this service again as it is clearly disorganized, unreliable and relays dishonest information to customers. This resolution and the way this issue was handled is unacceptable and a very poor and inconsiderate display of customer service. If Publix stays affiliated with instacart as their delivery method, I will no longer shop there. Publix is known for their great customer service, which is clearly not what instacart offers it’s customers.According to these reviews, this sort of poor customer experience is to be expected from this company. I am truly sorry I did not read these reviews before I decided to trust my holiday meal to instacart."

Got my deliveries and first off I never received a few items that the ""shopper"" never bother marking so I never got my refund for them and had to chase the customer service department afterwards. Secondly I reviewed the receipts from the stores vs what I was charged and the difference was over $35. I didn't realise they were inflating the cost of the actual groceries. To be honest this is meant to make grocery shopping convenient for people but all I've experienced is a headache afterwards just to make sure I wasn't ripped off. Save yourselves the trouble and just get delivery directly from grocery stores. Metro only charges 3.99 for delivery and you can get same day so it's really no different except you save more money and are dealing with a reputable company who has good customer service in the event something goes wrong."

We ended having to grab people from our company to haul it to the right building and delayed our holiday party. When I called customer service about this, I was on the phone with them for hours and their only resolution was a $20 credit and they promised to call back, which no one did.

Smile, brush it off, and essentially give their customers a big F U.Today, rather reluctantly, I tried the service again, after not bothering since this past August due to many of the reasons already stated. Again, without fail, their shopper neglected to reach out to me when they couldn't find certain items, made adjustments without my consent, and somehow confused cinnamon rolls for biscuits. Instacart put a $100 hold on my card for $50 worth of groceries and won't let me change the tip to a far more appropriate 10 % for such crappy service (I use 20% as a default. It takes a lot for me to tip less than 20%).So I will continue to do my best to NEVER have to rely on Instacart.

Since we started this service Feb, 2019 there have been 5 different times the driver was denied getting on a military post because they had failed the background check. There are shoppers that are shady and have a criminal background. Instant Cart claims there employees have a background check. Not true! Not only having to trust these drivers but with my debit and credit card information that could end up in a legal situation or entanglement.As of Dec 6, 2019 there services are no longer needed and terminated for bad service, horrible customer service, outsourcing customer service representatives who knows from where or what country? Electing drivers to come on post who can’t. Marking up prices way above store price.

My coupons aren't used, my Loyalty card is not used; it's not even allowed. You claim to provide me with coupons and savings, but if I'm not getting the store's discounted price, I'm paying the suggested retail price, which is usually a LOT more, so in the end, I'm really saving nothing by using Instacart. I would save much more money and be able to use my fuel points with my loyalty card, if I go through store to order instead. And if I use their pickup service, then I don't have to pay your delivery and service fees at all.I also want to add that I have learned that you rip off your employees/shoppers. You pay them next to nothing while they slave for hours and wear down their cars and spend their measly earnings on gas/vehicle upkeep. You actually paid them well in the beginning but have since figured out more and more methods of paying them less while making even more money off of their backs. And then recently, if they try and stand up for their rights, you take away their bonuses. I appreciate a 5-star shopper, but now I hear that they don't even get rewarded for being one anymore. As a result, I'm seeing a drop in quality, and I don't blame them. If you're not paying them enough, they're not going to be happy and therefore aren't going to care enough about their jobs to give quality service.You tell your shoppers to not give the customers their receipts. First of all, that's deceitful! But some shoppers don't know this and have given it to me anyway, and when I review these receipts, I can see that I get nothing BOGO, I get none of my coupons, I don't get my fuel points, and the loyalty card being used is not MY number, it's YOUR number. I can see on these receipts that I could have saved $10-20 in most cases... hmmm isn't that funny? That is EXACTLY what my supposedly waived delivery and service fee would have been! So you tell customers if we pay for Express, we're waiving the fees, but we pay nearly full price for everything, so it just puts that money right back on and we're technically paying it after all!I think at one time, Instacart was a great company, but you have since become deceitful and misleading. You treat your employee/shoppers badly, and you cheat your customers by hiding the real truth of what you're charging in the fine print.I'm going to go back to shopping for my own groceries, or using my store's pickup service. There's no way I'm contributing another penny to your company.Save your money. Don't use them. Force them to have no choice but to pay their employees fairly. Shoppers are very often paid less than minimum wage. they are not employees, they are independent contractors, so this is how IC gets away with it. A year or so ago, shoppers went on strike (as is their right), and the bonus they received for having a 5 star rating for 1 week was removed (this was a $100, well-deserved bonus). Recently, they went on strike again on the platform to receive better default tips, and they removed the Quality Bonus, which was a measly $3 for each 5 star rating. Now they get absolutely nothing for receiving or maintaining a 5 star rating. An example of a delivery order they might receive is to drive 10-20 miles to the requested store, shop 56 items, deliver another 5 miles to the customer, bring it to their door with a smile on their face, and for this, Instacart (in this particular example) paid the shopper $7.85! And on top of this, the customer paid no tip up front... maybe they'll pay in cash upon arrival, or add the tip later, but in most cases, they do not.Don't trust this company. they're crooks. If you don't believe me, continue using them, but watch your receipts, pay attention. Shop once in your store with your loyalty card, then once using IC and then compare your savings. I promise you, they're ripping you off."

INSTACART DOES NOT DESERVE YOUR MONEY!,"I have been using Instacart for a few years. This year, I had been using this service multiple times a month, sometimes twice a week. One thing I noticed is that there was almost always something wrong with my order. The last couple of times I used the service, I see the shopper was replacing my vegan items with non-vegan items. I messaged them and told them not to pick up those items. They did not listen. A few moments after I sent the message, they finished shopping, which prevented me from being able to contact them. This infuriated me. I sent instacart two messages informing them that I no longer wanted the entire order because of how rude and dismissive the shopper was. Then I remembered that I could call them. So I called and let the rep know that I no longer wanted this order.It took almost 30 minutes for me to argue my case as to why I no longer wanted the order. As I was on the phone with the rep, the delivery showed up and was placed outside of my front door. The shopper was gone before I could reject the order. The rep was still on the phone as I discovered the food outside my door. I told him that he needed to send someone to pick up the groceries because I refuse to take them. The person offended me by selecting replacements that were not vegan and not meeting my requests. This person was forcing me to pay for items I would never be able to eat. So I told the guy I would instead give the whole order back and go to the grocery store on my own when I had time.The Instacart rep assured me that I would not be charged, and I could give the groceries away or throw them away if I wanted because I would not be charged for them.Because of this, I gave the groceries away. I still continued to use Instacart for over a month. Then suddenly, I received multiple emails stating that my account had been frozen due to a dispute with my bank.I NEVER FILED A DISPUTE. I trusted that the rep was honest when he stated that I would get a refund.They stated that my account would be reinstated after the dispute was settled. They told me that I had to cancel the dispute and pay for the order, then they would refund the items that I didn't want.I explained to them that I was so furious that I didn't accept the order. So I gave the groceries to a family member. I told them that I didn't dispute but instead was offered a FULL REFUND. The stated that I needed to cancel and pay to get my account reinstated.They also mentioned some other charges from 3-4 months ago that they could not complete. I understood this because I lock my card once I'm done with an order. I always keep my credit cards locked. So if they try to charge after the fact, (tip, price difference, etc.) they won't be able to. I told them that this was my mistake, and they could now charge me for the little 3 or 4 dollars. By the end of the chain of emails, I was told that I owed them 100+ dollars, and until I paid, I would not be able to use the service.I asked for documented proof of this, and I never got clear documented evidence. They typed up a list with dates, and I matched it up to find that I only actually owed a few bucks — not 100. THIS COMPANY IS GREEDY, AND THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE QUALITY OF SERVICE THAT THEY PROVIDE.Instead of punishing me, the shopper is the one who was in the wrong, and they are the ones who should've paid the consequences.Today after a long month of going through this, I get an email from them telling me that they can no longer provide services to me, and to refer to their terms in conditions.SO THEY BASICALLY TRIED TO BULLY ME INTO PAYING FOR GROCERIES THAT I NEVER USED AND DISCONTINUED SERVICES BECAUSE I REFUSED TO PAY."

I am confident they make more money at that other publix. They are bait and switch company and completely unethical. When you try to reach them to find out why they are doing this behavior instead of getting the food from the local Publix as promised, they do not answer you.

They stop allowing the grocery delivery person to bring you your receipts because they are hiding the fact that they are stealing money from you. I called to find out why my paper receipt was so much less than my emailed receipt from instacart and they just told me it was my fee for using their service. What? I pay a monthly fee for using a service and I also tip the driver very well. This was not disclosed by the way they tried to tell me it was but the statement under prices may vary to store to store made no flipping sense! So this hidden fee and it is very hidden not shown to you at all and changes every time you order, is how they make more money. I would not have a problem with paying more in my monthly fee. This is charging you as high as it can on the items at the store before there discounted or set at the price that usually are at. So you never know what you're being charged and they could not tell me who was receiving the extra payment. Nor could they tell me how much it would be every time I shop. It's completely random. Actually it's on every single item I purchased the price was higher through instacart then it was on my receipt. I then explained to the manager that I would not pay for a service that I didn't know what I was paying each time or ever know what I was paying since they don't tell you! She had to agree with me she wouldn't want to do that either. These people should be shut down by the Better Business Bureau. It's basically like having your lawn mowed for you and telling them to help them self to the spare cash in your cupboard. Now if you're like me I'm not always sure how much exactly is in my spare cash can so who knows how much I paid the lawn person or how much they took. And I never will. Because I didn't get a receipt from him. That is so dirty and disgraceful that they actually are keeping receipts from people!

You’ll get up to date, if your employees made accurate notes about all the calls I’ve made to you, Instacart, my bank, and credit card company customer service. Recap I had $200 set aside for my family Thanksgiving. I ordered delivery of groceries from Kroger.  I’m a senior citizen and disabled which I can’t drive.  Next I get a text from Instacart they're running 2 hours behind. I chatted with the shopper via of text on substitutions. It went silent for about 45 minutes when I get an email, not text, driver needs gate code. I replied via of text and email 154. I get another email ""Meet shopper outside. He can’t find you.""I go downstairs and the gate was propped open, people were moving, and didn’t see anyone in my small half circle driveway entrance/exit in front of my complex. I text and emailed, ""The gate has been open since 8:30pm, my delivery was so delayed it was around 10:15pm.  I asked the guys moving how long they had the gate open.  Your driver's Was at the wrong property."" Next I get an email my order was cancelled! That was our thanksgiving groceries. I sent 8 emails to customer service with Instacart to bring my order. You put a pending charge of $169.07 on my credit card that wouldn’t drop off for 7-10 days. I called the bank, cc company, you, Instacart starting at 4am day before thanksgiving. I only had available $30 left of credit to buy thanksgiving on my card since $169.07 had been deducted for my delivery the night before.  A Kroger supervisor, heartless, said the best he would do is give me a $50 credit.I was furious for so much deception. The only way I could use the $50 was to get delivery! Forcing me to use you and Kroger again when you already had my $169.07. I didn’t see the credit of $50 on my account so I called Kroger and was told to type in “I have a $50 credit“ on a product instructions for substitutions. I couldn’t spend over $30 because I had to put my cc down again and your rep said you wouldn’t make any charges. After checkout the $50 would be applied. This is what happen. You took the amount of groceries from my cc leaving me with no money to buy thanksgiving and to top it off, you had the audacity to charge me a delivery fee plus driver tip. Subtracted from that “$50 credit”. You didn’t give me $50. It worked out to be around $35. Once again you also put a pending charge on my cc leaving $3 available credit. You stole my family’s thanksgiving.I’m sending this to you on thanksgiving since the only thing I had ingredients to make was a cake and bread in our bread machine. I hope you enjoyed your thanksgiving knowing you stole my family’s thanksgiving. We’re new to Dallas so we don’t have anyone to even help us out. I will be posting this on every social network, Kroger’s and Instacart website reviews, App Store, and sending this scam to channel 4.5 and 8. It is so hard on me when I have 3 sons home from college and can’t give them thanksgiving. I feel so stressed out, anxiety, depressed, like a horrible single parent. This is because, even though both companies knew my money had been blocked for pending, we had no groceries, and we would not have any food for thanksgiving, YOU DID NOTHING! You should feel embarrassed and ashamed of kicking me to the street.I want my money released immediately, something to make up for my family not having thanksgiving except for a cake and loaf of bread, and some type of reprimand to every heartless, horrible customer service employee, like Mary, that I pleaded plus begged to help me, the day before thanksgiving, to just bring me my groceries.  I hope my testimony goes viral on the web and others will share it with all their threads.  It is so unbelievably I can’t believe this happen.  How does your company pay your bills?  What type of consumers use your service?  I posted this on FB and a lot of the comments even added your a horrible company to be employee.  You treat your drivers that do the shopping like bottom drawer individuals.  What’s ironic is it actually you that is bottom drawer.  I’m on a fixed income with 3 sons in college, which still did not help escalate this to any authority to solve this problem. I expect a reply that will rectify all the wrong you did to me for thanksgiving.You should be put out of business.  Here’s a problem solver a child could get right: why didn’t you go get my groceries, since you still had $169.07 pending for you to use, and bring them to me?  I don’t believe you even had a person shopping for me the night before.  Knowing your customer service is the worst, you had already admitted you were running hours behind, I don’t believe you even attempted my delivery.  The whole “you shopping” was made up.  It sure was not because a gate was closed, or your driver didn’t have a GPS.  Another possibility, having gotten so many comments on Facebook, your driver could have just quit their job to burn you since you treat them so bad.  You are such a “wrong”, “worse”, “joke” of a company the possibility’s are endless of who despises and has a payback towards you.  I wonder how many of your bills are in the third and last notice status to keep your lights on.  Regardless there’s something not right because no one can succeed treating other people like what you did to my family, and me, on thanksgiving.May you file for bankruptcy!"

No experience needed.Unfortunately,this is not so!Once you apply, a in person session is scheduled. There are two blocked times (9-12)or (2-6). Instructions of what to bring with you and a warning not to be late are emphasis on their app.  which you are required to download and in a personal text. Behold the meeting of this session is at some open random place with table and chairs in a middle of a mall/plaza. Since, it was cold outside and the group of applicants were small this session was moved to the near by Barnes and Nobles. (So this business doesn't have a hub for the interview process) The hiring area rep was cold,no emotion (never introduced or shook hands ,no eye contact)but very rule to the point oriented. It was part of the meeting email to wear casual business and be 10 mins. early ! But she was in a faded t- shirt and worn  jeans. She'd arrived exactly on time with another women . Then she had computer issues?Eventually,the process started and she did introduce herself. She began reading policies,company rules and  requirements. Every now and then she'd asked if her words were understood. Quickly,after the ten minute of introduction,she plops a laminated guide of instructions of what to do next to continue the process. Now,you are on your ownIt was first a test of how well you can use you phone and follow instructions. When anyone asked for her help she would strongly deny any assistance? This was interesting since in own words just finished stating that instacart is a family and we all help each other???There are two simple logical assessment test. Must pass to continue hiring process.These take about five minutes each to complete. Then the interview in which you must decide when you can work?...this is not how they advertise the job.They demand set times for you to schedule yourself to training even before hiring.The flexable work schedule does not exist...even though you can guarantee available  hours ..right away it is made known that hours might not be available. So basically,the job model presented to the public is different from the company's requirements and  expectations. Needless, to say out of the seven that came in good faith seeking employment on that chilly Monday morning no one was hired. A big waste of time.Also, during  this process the area supervisor and her colleague was doing other company business. Yes, with me sitting there, in the middle of Barnes and Nobles these two fired a Male Costco employee. Also, were spying on a female employee actually going through the checkout at Costcos while saying,""I never fire anybody while they are working""Real professional. So, be aware and ready if you apply at instacart. The job description seen by the public is not true. Be ready for the challenges of meeting their requirements."

For the shopper the Minimum payment is $7 used to be $10 which they always try to pay they tell the customer to tip bare minimum. When I started there was a $3 bonus if the order was early or on time. They got rid of that because too many shoppers were making there bonuses in favor of a $3 bonus for a 5 star customer rating which people rarely do they recently just got rid of the bonus all together.

The company flat out said they can't fulfill my order because they don't have enough shoppers in the 4th largest city in the country.

So, after your bill has now doubled and they give you an hour window, they do not uphold their end of the deal. Your groceries can take several hours to arrive, with no updated delivery schedule, leaving you unable to leave your house while you wait. Finally, I've had delivery drivers deliver me expired milk, as if they dont read the expiration date. Just when you think that's enough, if you dont tip beforehand BEWARE OF AN ANGRY DRIVER, there were several occasions in which the driver never knocked on the door, or messaged, and left my groceries outside my front door while I awaited an app that didn't update me. By the time I walked outside I was able to stop a neighborhood person from picking through my groceries. At the end of the experience the driver has taken there 15% tip and you have paid insta cart an additional 14 dollars for a crappy service, and a fight with the neighborhood thief who saw groceries sitting outside. So your options are pre-tip well and pray the driver wont take 3 hours, at the price of 1 hour delivery, or try to tip when the driver gets there and pray that they care enough to not toss your groceries haphazardly on your front lawn, like a yard sale!!"

Not only did Instacart not deliver my groceries but after waiting around for two hours with no groceries or further communication, I had to call them myself to inquire about my grocery status. The only recourse offered was rescheduling my delivery for the next day, at a time after the event had already happened. That’s it, that’s all they offered to make it better. When I asked to speak to a supervisor he told me, in a very monotone voice, that he could only reschedule my groceries and offer me a $10 credit on my NEXT order. As if I would want to use this service again and as if $10 at all makes up for the egregious error. I ended up having to wake up extra early to go buy new groceries myself and put the two dishes together.

I thought some of the prices seemed pretty high so I cross referenced on The superstore’s online ordering system. Instacart said they charge 7.5% service fee, $3 for delivery and a 10% tip for the shopper. Parmesan cheese that was $8 on line was $10.95. Coffee that was $9.99 online was $18.99 (Yes, I got the exact same size and brand etc.). Pepperoni that was $11.95 online was $14.95.  So not sure if there was going to be 7.5% on top of these much higher prices as those prices do not reflect 7.5%. After spending all morning texting back and forth with the Shopper, around 12:30 I found out there was a problem at the Superstore with their POS system. I received several texts about it from my shopper. I offered to come down and pay cash and was told to wait until she could talk to Support. Then I got a phone call from Support asking me to hold. I did for several minutes, was cut off and when I called back I was told my order had been suspended and the shopper had left the store 10 minutes earlier. What a waste of time. I won’t use these guys again.

If you shop four times a month with an average $10 markup plus the delivery fee that is $50 a month the company is charging!!!! Is that explained in their advertising or am I just confused again?  Needless to say, I will not be doing business with them any longer."

I was hoping to find an easier way to shop since our local store is a big frustration. Instacart has its own set of issues though.  The delivery did not come in the delivery window, which made me have to adjust my schedule. Several items were out of stock at the store the shopper picked, but not at my closest local store. The vegetables all came loose in a brown paper bag that was wet and tearing at the bottom from the moist veggies, and the vegetables (all thrown in together) were quite hammered by the time they were unpacked. Also I have no plastic bags at home so had to wrap broken heads of lettuce and kale in plastic wrap to put in my fridge. The very worst samples of vegetables were picked: a package of tomatoes that were liquid inside and on the verge of spoiling, a small, hardened red pepper, a cauliflower head that was about 75% green stalk with only a 3 or 4"" head, and a tiny pineapple that is about two weeks away from ripening. The bananas and the iceberg lettuce were forgotten, but I did get a big green cabbage that I did not order, but the root end was already grey and slimy in its packaging. Instead of refunding me for the skipped items, Instacart says they will discount my next order. The coupons I usually get at my local store are not reflected in an Instacart purchase either. Using Instacart seems is just swapping one set of problems for another, but not solving any hassles overall."

https://ca.trustpilot.com/reviews/5dc9d603c845450918beb2a1,Maggie Seider,1 star: Bad,"What a nightmare, I wish I had checked here before trying to use this service.","After my first and most likely last time trying Instacart, I feel very sorry for the person who shopped and delivered about 70% of what I ordered.  these are the problems I had:1) All of the fresh meat items were not in stock, nor was some on sale produce and fried chicken from the deli.  Really?  On a Saturday mid day?  No rainchecks on sale items?  2) The instacart website kept pushing me to buy things I did not want by offering money off if I bought a certain amount.  On one of these, I did buy the $20.00 for the $5.00 off, but did not get the $5.00 off.  I did get products I would never buy after looking at the ingredients.  No idea why I didn't get the $5.00 off or if they ever give it.  3) No paper receipt and customer service said store would not honor digital receipt for returns.  What? I haven't tried as yet, but will be shocked if Publix refuses to return money for an item that was 40 DAYS PAST the ""sell by"" date. as well as non perishables I would never have bought if I could have seen the labels.  If I ever did use this service again, or if you want to try, I would avoid the promotions like the plague.  Huge waste of time and money.4) Non disclosed charges (a $2.00 fee to deliver a bottle of cooking wine) Customer Service said they did not see the fee which was a surprise on the digital receipt which customer service ZEN DESK) kept referring me to.  Why can't they see it and why did they lie and say I was not charged a hidden fee that was clearly on the receipt?5) ZEN DESK is awful and has been driving me crazy with contradictory emails that have wasted more time than it would have taken to go and buy the things I actually wanted to buy.  They have issued credits for the wrong items and refuse to even try to figure it out after asking me detailed questions they then ignored the answer to. They refer to credits as refunds but to get them I would have to use this awful service again.6) This is supposed to be a convenience, but it turns out you have to be in constant chat with your shopper, and everything has to be written twice as instacart doesn't seem to ever like the first way you respond. (phone or computer)  It is neither convenient, time saving and it is very expensive with hidden fees and clearly underpaid workers who have no motivation to be good shoppers.7) A bad service, terrible customer service and no way to communicate with the company.  When you try to leave feedback they only want to know about tipping and if you liked the poor person working for them.  No way to let them know about problems with their service or charges.  They hand you off to Zen Desk and they haven't got a clue and only waste more time.Finally, If this were a reliable and convenient service who did not push purchases of garbage with discounts they don't give, if they kept up with store inventory on any level at all so most items that really are wanted can be purchased, I would not mind paying the over 15% surcharge plus a real tip. However for this bungled mess I feel I should have been paid."

After 30 minutes of selecting items and replacements I went to check out was re-routed to instacart where my card and account was instantly blocked for using a different email address when I was not even on the instacart site or app.  Let me be clear here - same name, same delivery address, same phone number, same credit card, matching delivery, billing and shipping address and all the same as all my previous orders except the email address. But instead of a pop up “we seem to have a customer with this info please log in with correct email address” they block my account, my credit card, delete my order. All this would be frustrating enough but their customer service is beyond terrible - rude, disrespectful, inefficient, abysmal comprehension, beyond useless at problem solving. and not customer oriented at all. Refused to help me telling me to email help@ telling me to directly respond to “account flagged” emails which explicitly stated “no response needed”. Refused to unblock my account without me sending my government ID and picture of both sides of credit card via email, refused to delete my Instacart account, could not even  explain why my entire cart had been deleted.

They managed to get over 85% Bad Reviews. Well, here's mine to add to the list. Worst experience ever. WHY WHY does Ralph’s use this service to deliver their groceries? For the first time I ordered from Ralph’s to get groceries for a party. I had an elaborate checkout experience and then they ask you the timeframe you want your groceries. I chose 11-12 pm. I wasn’t going to be home sooner and I had ordered ice so I needed it at a specific time. Losers at Instacart text me at 9:08 saying they were getting my groceries ready. I texted them back deliver between 11-12 pm. Then the losers text me at 10:05 saying they will deliver my groceries in two minutes. Losers. Why have a customer select a timeframe if they will do whatever they want and attempt to deliver whenever, what kinda idiotic service is this. And I am paying them??So they said they will contact Ralph’s with me on the call. The stupid Customer Ambassador is like well you’re gonna need to cancel so that you can reorder by 11-12. I was like, HUH?? Why would I have to cancel my order to reorder again because you losers decide to shop sooner. And make me the customer reorder an order that should have been originally delivered between 11-12 in the first place. What a crap show. Not only was I stressed out before my party thinking getting groceries delivered would be a good idea. NOT, I end up canceling with these losers and Ralph’s so I can go shopping myself, waste of time. Party was late because had to run to get the drinks and food.Ralph’s tried to offer me 30 dollars and I said no. You give me 60 dollars credit for being jerks and never will I use their Instacart silly delivery services again in my life. Their Instacart customer service people lack critical thinking skills and customer service losers follow some process and orders that makes no sense to support their customers? How this company remains in business I don’t know. And why a reputable company like Ralph’s would use them is even more idiotic. Instacart never offered me any compensation for wasting my time either. No wonder jobs are going out of the country. If you have losers like this no wonder jobs will go to people who wanna work and actually care."

I forced him to give me an email address to send him the proof.

HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"It's true that Instacart charges more, often a lot more, for items than the grocery stores do, but I was WILLING to accept the costs in exchange for the convenience.  That premium, however, should also mean that if SOMETHING IS WRONG, that the customer should have the confidence to know that Instacart will make it right.  THEY DON'T, THEY WON'T, AND THEY REALLY DON'T CARE.  You mean NOTHING to them.  NOTHING.I recently purchased two one pound containers of crab meat from Wegman's using Instacart.  I was heading out on a week long vacation and didn't have time to do the shopping, so I was glad to have a service like Instacart to help me out.  I was heading to a very rural area without cell service and wifi, and my parents had asked me if I'd bring some crab meat since they can't get it where they live.After arriving, I unpacked the crab meat from the cooler and noticed that the expiration date on the bottom was APRIL 2019, and it was already late October of 2019, so the meat was SIX MONTHS EXPIRED!!  Each tub, at Instacart prices was $30, so we're talking $60 worth of expired crab meat.  Clearly, the Instacart shopper didn't check the date, and by the time I did, I was 500 miles from home with no way to remedy the situation.Upon returning home 9 days later, I went to the store to make a return.  I was told that since it was Instacart, I'd have to contact them and do the return through them.  I immediately contacted Instacart and explained the situation.  THEY REFUSED TO REFUND THE COST OF THE EXPIRED PRODUCT BECAUSE, ""IT HAD BEEN MORE THAN SEVEN DAYS SINCE IT WAS PURCHASED.""  So, it didn't matter that their shopper delivered expired product to me.  It didn't matter that the product was SIX MONTHS past its expiration date.  It didn't matter that I was unable to attend to the matter while I was away.  It didn't matter that I was a loyal customer that got grocery deliveries every week.  NONE OF THAT MATTERED AT ALL.  So beware.  If you need a grocery delivery service, then honestly, I'd look at a different source.  Instacart is not worth the risk if they are unwilling to consider legitimate customer complaints."

I have also had people accept my batches and then just never show up with anything at all and on two different occasions now I have caught druggy instacart shoppers doing their drugs in the driveway in front of my own home! One time they were snorting something and threw the baggy out of their car window (caught that one on camera) and the other time they were smoking something on what appeared to be aluminum foil which I also caught on camera. All of these times I contacted instacart. At first I was told they would look into these issues and the people responsible would be reprimanded. Now instacart tells me that even though I have supplied them proof of these issues that there is nothing they can do because they were not present to see these things happen for themselves.

I canceled my account on October of 2019, after months of missing items; that I was charged for; products that was out of date, bad, and just plain old and moldy; and shoppers and delivery drivers that had no idea how to shop.  But what broke the bank was that I placed an order for delivery the next day, somebody shopped the order, then a separate driver picked up the order, my groceries rode in the back of the delivery driver's trunk, in 80 degree weather, for 1 whole hour, until she showed up at my house.  The meat I purchased was warm, smashed bananas, my frozen pizza was defrosted, and most of my produce didn't last as long as I should have.It took 2 days for Instacart to answer my complaint email, in which time I canceled my express subscription.  When Instacart answered my email, they offered me $7.59 refund and one more month of the express subscription, that's when I canceled the account.During the last year (2019), is when the service has really gotten terrible, as Instacart has enacted even more rules and regulations.  Very rarely did the delivery drivers have temperature controlled bags for refrigerated goods, and many of the drivers just care about getting a positive feed back score. What Instacart really needs to do is to better train their workers how to shop, how to bag groceries, shadow shoppers and delivery drivers to make sure they are doing the job they were hired for.The grocery delivery business is big, but Instacart has missed the mark."

At the beginning of 2019, my orders were on time, every single time. It seemed that the person shopping the order was also always the one delivering the order, which seemed to work very well. However this changed at some point and the shopper was separated from the delivery person.The consistent issue I have run into as a result of this is that, while the shopper finishes shopping my order usually within a half hour of ordering, the delivery happens late every single time. I usually get a notification some time within the delivery window that the order is late. This would be okay if it was once in a while, but it happens during every single order now.I select the ""within 2 hours"" whenever it is available. Sometimes it is not available, which signals to me that it is not possible for a delivery within 2 hours...fine, that's logical. However, when this window is available, I expect (as a paying Express member), that there is sufficient shoppers/delivery couriers available to make the order delivery on time.I just cancelled an order today because it was late and I didn't even receive a notification. Having called customer support for this same issue three times before, this time the agent informed me that Instacart cannot guarantee delivery within the selected window....even though Instacart has the ability to change the available windows based on service availability. This unfortunate fact is not found in the terms of service to my knowledge, which is understandable because I'm sure it would likely not be good for business. I am no longer confident in the quality of this service and will no longer be using Instacart. The 10% markup, lack of price adjustment for in-store sales/promotions, and Express for $99 per year is no longer worth it if I can't even get an order on time anymore."

Twice, I have picked a delivery time between 4:00 to 5:00 p.m. and both times my groceries have gotten to my home 30 minutes earlier than that time slot. I, purposefully, chose that time slot so that my groceries would arrive around the same time that I arrive home. Both times the shoppers said that they aren't told what the time slots are.

If they charge you for an item and you don’t receive it they don’t credit back your debit card, nor do they try to make it right and deliver the item, the only option is a credit on your next order. They call it their customer resolution.  Also, noticed the prices are much higher $$ than if you were to order directly from market. I don’t recommend. I cancelled my membership no refund, my membership remains valid until the expiration date then it’s cancelled.

The first time I get a text saying that my driver Odyssey has delivered my order at 2:09pm. I was at home waiting and I didn’t her the doorbell, so I check the front door, nothing; so I thought that they might have left it at the front desk which shouldn’t be ok because I asked to deliver to apt door. So I go downstairs to check, and there was no delivery for me. I called the Instacart customer service and the lady couldn’t get in touch with the driver, so she ordered a redelivery. Two hours later, I get a message saying that my order was delivered at 4:39pm, so I run to the front door, again nothing so I go straight to the front desk, and to my horror there is no delivery. I had changed my plans around to wait for this order so I can put the perishables in the fridge before leaving. When I call Instacart, the rep tracks the driver Neil down and put him on the line. The driver proceeds to tell me that he gave the order to some guy outside with a blue Nike shirt who offered to help and knew where to take the order........What the ..#%.?? Is this how Instacart does business? Can the driver deliver to any random person? I specifically put in the delivery notes to come upstairs. How can my order be delivered to a random person without even checking that it was being delivered to the right person??. I never found out what happened with the first undelivered order but is just UNACCEPTABLE. I have requested a refund, but I will never get my time back. I will never use this service again."

While the first delivery person was efficient and friendly, I was not provided with a paper receipt to prove what I had actually paid for the items. The 2nd delivery person started shopping an hour after I placed the order (when it was due to arrive), shopped for 2 items and then dropped the order completely for the next 1.5 hours. Finally, I get a message from said person 3:30 minutes after delivery time, saying that they cannot find certain item despite telling them exactly where it is in store. He finally showed up 4 hours later, the first 2 item are missing, and in the bag is a paper receipt which says I paid for them PLUS i have been overcharged for every other item on the receipt. I dispute the charges with Instacart, they offer to refund me the price of the missing items (7-10 business days), but refuse to give me back the $8 extra I was overcharged for the items. They also told me it would take 3-5 business days to get back the $40 they stole in the beginning. Overall, I wish I had read the reviews of this scam before ordering. There were several other options available to me for grocery delivery but I will never use any service again because of this experience. This world is full of crooks!"

They pre-charge me $65. on my debit card and said that in 7 days I would be charged $55. when the total of my order from the receipt the delivery instacart driver gave me was only $47.03. I called up Instacart's customer service and explained to them I had given a $5 cash tip and I even put that on my order I placed at Aldi's delivery service. The Instcart customer service employee said that I was still going to be charged $55. How is this legal? Sounds like stealing to me. They are a very shady business and I will never use them again.

The receipt I found in the bag says the total is $193.53 (188.32+0.25+4.93). Why am I being charged $9.45 extra?My order total came to $210.98 (with tip) when it should have been $201.53.I am very concerned that I have been mislead in regards to prices for all of my orders and it could have been $100s of dollars charged extra.If wal-mart is charging the instacart shopper $193.25 in store via paper reciept...  Is wal-mart receiving the extra money digitally - or is instacart? And why isn't this information apparent on my digital receipt?It's very upsetting and misleading.I understand that the prices in stores might be different than on the app, but shouldn't the actual total of the groceries on the paper receipt be what is updated/recorded and charged digitally for the customer?Where does the extra charged money go if not back to the customer?I am really confused and upset with this. It is super misleading and confusing for your customers - and I feel really awful for just noticing this now after months of ordering groceries this way.What happens when my instacart shopper purchases mushrooms on clearance for a good price and I am charged full price for not fresh mushrooms? What if my instacart shopper picks up the 2 smallest pieces of brocolli weighing only $1.48 and I am charged $5.04?I am very very unhappy.

Don't refer anyone and expect to get anything-you're S.O.L. if they so much as take a few days off and are 1 or 2 batches shy of 35 batches by the 30 day deadline. You trip and fall a couple times minorly and injure yourself but don't know you are injured until a while later and don't think anything of it until you have to report it a month later cuz you need surgery? Good luck. They do not care. They'll screw up your account and laugh at your problems. They will not resolve anything without an hour and a half PLUS of time on the phone or more AFTER hearing employees guve one excuse or lie after another as to why they cannot transfer you. Even then they'll tell you you're S.O.L. and lie to your face over and over again. They'll leave you in tears wishing you'd never worked for them. Their is no disclaimer about potential injuries or suggested/mandatory reads BEFORE completing your order let alone a proper tutorial or training. You are independent contractors expected to be alone without guidance cuz you so much as ask a question and they avoid giving a direct answer or Sometimes ANY answer at all!! Only after escalating for hours will you suddenly be treated like a human. Both myself and a family member have been treated so poorly by this company we will not refer anyone else nor will we reach out to customer service who obviously doesn't care. We'll get our batches done and earn our money but no more hassle with the rest of it unless we absolutely have to.
https://ca.trustpilot.com/reviews/5da554b86048580b483e4f75,Ashley Johnson,1 star: Bad,An unethical nightmare.,"*11/8/19 edit: Negative stars. On the heels of us protesting for our tip to go back to a lame 10% from 5% instacart decided to remove our $3 pay bump that we got for good ratings from customers - a great incentive for us to do a good job gone. Not only will shoppers have far less earning opportunity - but customers will feel the ramifications of this. And it was just because the leaders of the company wanted to be petty and punish us for organizing. Like children. Instacart was an okay company to work for in the beginning but it continues to get progressively worse - even when we already think it's as low as it can go. The last shifts I worked average at HALF of minimum wage. We're talking one low pay for 3 long distance deliveries where tips still impact the pay you accept or are later removed for things out of your control. And when we do multiple orders customers are not informed - meaning they are mad at us when it takes longer or their food is thawed out (and either chew us out or remove our tip). This is while you pay for your own gas, your own insurance, your own health care, your own car maintenance, etc. Sometimes you end up spending your money to work for instacart leaving you in the negative.  The market is so over saturated with shoppers that I am sometimes 25 in line just to get a shift (which means I can't just work when I want to work). I tried pre scheduling what ever shifts I could get on the wait list for - but then you have to immediately decide when it opens up if you can take that shift - and if for some reason you end a shift early (even if there is 25 other people ready to take the orders) you get a penalty which impacts your future work and pay. The bonuses, including the referral bonuses, are skewed to be unattainable. We are also rushed through orders (and that timer doesn't stop when we're on the phone with support for an app issue or in a long check out line, mind you). This means we can't actually take the time to find the perfect produce or make good replacements. Slow times = less future pay. The customers have been well conditioned by the owner to leave horrendous tips, if they tip at all. They regularly abuse instacart to avoid commercial delivery fees for things ranging from 800-1500 lbs (which our cars and insurance are technically unable to do - and yes even on 3 cart orders you are timed!). The owner himself doesn't tip drivers when they deliver to his $6.4M loft. When there are abusive customers (ie: those looking to sexually assault women who show up alone to deliver groceries) they are not removed from the platform - infact instacart's response was to make sure a lot of addresses are hidden on orders to force us to accept the order (is it the nice lady in building 2 or the creepy man who corned us and made lewd comments in building 5? SURPRISE). This company has faced many lawsuits - and will continue to face them. And unfortunately as their pay continues to treat the workers as subhuman the customers will suffer. Most of the shoppers who remain are either burnt out or not quality shoppers to begin with. Also - instacart has actually fought with lobby money against your shoppers needing to obtain a food handlers permit so don't be surprised if your meat is next to your produce. I suggest looking into the articles us shoppers have posted on medium, the screencaps posted on twitter detailing the theft, the actual item pricing versus what is on your receipt, and alternative more ethical delivery options."

The fine print of their terms agreement does state that prices may be different, but they do not explain why. I shopped at our local store today and then went and created an order for the exact same items to see the cost difference.

Two minutes after placing the order I received a text saying that they were running behind and the delivery would be between 1 pm- 3pm.

I explained to the person that I did not receive the groceries that I had paid for and they were hours late. I was advised to cancel the order as they didn't have a person booked to shop/deliver the groceries yet. I asked to have my money refunded into my bank account immediately, and was advised that it takes 3-7 business days for a refund (on something I never received in the first place). So not only am I out the groceries that was to make my Thanksgiving dinner with, I am also out the money to buy new groceries for the holiday.

I normally physically shop in the supermarket but felt a delivery service would come in handy at times. My one and only use of the service was not for delivery - but a car pick up at the store (there are several parking spaces reserved.) I knew I would have my dog with me in the car that day and did not want to leave him in the car. The ordering was easy. The store actually tracked my car and came out with the groceries as I arrived. Very convenient. There was a $4 pick up fee that was waived for the first use of the service. I was not given a receipt and would have asked for it had I thought about it at the time. I got home and was able to print out a copy of the order with itemized items. A week or so later, I asked an InstaCart shopper in the same Publix store what their pricing policy was. She told me the prices were the same as the in-store prices. Not true. I went back to the store with my printed order and checked every price on the order. I found that there was a minimum price increase of 11% across the board. Some prices were much higher. Sale items were the only prices that matched the store's. I understand this is a service and I realize that it is a business that must turn a profit. But I did not like the fact that the InstaCart shopper mislead me (I won't say lied) about the pricing. I called to ask for my $99 subscription fee refunded. The guy on the other end argued with me until I finally told him I was extremely angry and to either give me a yes or a no on a refund. I was put on hold several times and the entire process took longer than 30 minutes. This service reminded me of a hotel booking service where I had a similar bad experience. The service might be good for the elderly, people with physically limiting debilitations, pregnant mothers, and people without transportation though this is certainly not an endorsement for this company. For the rest of us, it is probably more practical to do your own shopping or delay your trip to the store when you can get in on your own. Definitely avoid this company."

I called Sprouts to complain about the amount they charged for fennel (smallest piece I had ever seen). The manager told me to call Instacart, and Instacart would refund the fennel charge. That happened. But.... unlike my first Instacart experience, I found the shopper’s receipt in my bag. I asked the Instacart customer service rep questions about how they price items. The outcome of our conversation reveals what I think is a dishonest business practice. At least two produce items on my Instacart receipt were listed at a higher weight than the weights on the Sprouts’ receipt. It is not a lot of money, but are they doing this with orders on a regular basis? Who is going to bother weighing their produce to double-check? The rep informed me that I should not have received the Sprouts’ receipt — it would be marked as a missing receipt from the shopper. What a convenient way to keep the consumer unaware of their business practices! I thanked the rep for being polite, but said I think this practice is dishonest and will not use their services again. (Instacart charged a service fee and delivery fee on top of the Sprouts’ receipt. I thought these were how they make money. Plus, I paid a tip to the shopper, who I figure has nothing to do with Instacart’s pricing.)"

But if you’re able to hang in there, you’ll see what an absolute joke this company is. If not, just know I will never use instacart again or recommend it to anyone.I had been dealing with issues with instacart for almost two weeks. My father used my account for a purchase, then decided later on to create his own account. After his first order, instacart flagged his purchase, canceled it, and deactivated his account. We called to confirm that it wasn’t fraud and ask why this happened. Instacart’s reasoning changed every time I spoke to them. At first they said it was because his first order was too large and they thought it was fraud. We tried to confirm that it was us, but they would not allow us to reactivate his account over the phone. Instead they asked him to send a copy of his drivers license and credit card over email, which is absolutely ridiculous. I can confirm my identity through companies like Bank of America over the phone, so why I can’t confirm over the phone for a simple grocery delivery?Instacart also deleted my father’s credit card from my own separate account since the card was “flagged”, which wouldn’t have been an issue if they would have allowed me to add a new payment method, but they didn’t. Every time I tried to enter a credit card, I received an error code. I called them again and they said it was just an issue with their system and to try again in 15-30 min. When I called again, they said I was probably using the wrong web browser. When I confirmed that I had tried several web browsers, different credit cards, and THEIR OWN APP, they finally said they would escalate the issue into a “case” and that someone would contact me in 24-48 hours. 48 hours later, no one had contacted me. I call again, explain the issues with both my father’s account being deactivated, my account not allowing me to add a payment info, and no one following up with me for 48 hours. The customer service agent told me someone at instacart closed our case without speaking to us which is why no one contacted us. She also said we DID NOT have to send our drivers license and credit card over email, and guaranteed that she herself would get back to me in 24 hours. She never did. I call back two days later and request to speak to a manager because now the new customer service agent claims they have no information on the issues that I’ve been calling about for days. The customer service agent tried multiple times to get me to end the call and agree to another callback but I refused, because no one had ever called me back before and I did not trust that they would follow through. I sat on hold for an hour when a manager finally got on the line. He said that sometimes these issues take at least a week to be fixed, even though they had originally said 24-48 hours. He said the problems in both accounts will be dealt with by the following week.A week later, I receive an email that MY account is now deactivated (dad’s is still deactivated too, no change there). Once again I call customer service and they claim they don’t have any information for me at this time, so I ask again to speak to a manager. When the manager gets on the line, I have to reexplain what happened and that now my account is deactivated, as well as my father’s. He first says that this is because the bank hasn’t verified our info yet and that it’s not their fault. When I question him more about it, he then says it’s because we haven’t emailed our drivers licenses and credit cards and that they can’t confirm our identities without them. Again, I tell him we do not want to send sensitive information like that over email and that an instacart employee told us we did not have to do so. He claims that employee is greatly mistaken and that our accounts won’t be reactivated until this happens. I ask why my account was even deactivated in the first place and the manger claims it’s because it is related to my father’s account. Please note my account and my father’s account are completely separate (different acct number, different address, different names). The only similarity between the accounts was the credit card my father used when he used my account to try out instacart (He’s 60 and not tech savvy). At this point I am beyond frustrated with instacart’s stories constantly changing and them not being able to provide any accurate information. I told the manager there is no reason that my account should be deactivated just because it had the same credit card stored, and that it does not say anywhere on their website that using the same credit card for more than one account is not allowed or recommended. Plus I could not change what credit card was saved anyway since instacart would not allow me to add a different payment method. The manager refused to listen or address my previous issues with their customer service team. He just kept stating that our accounts would not be activated until we submitted our DL and CC info over email and that we were the ones causing instacart to take so long in resolving the problem. He said he didn’t get why it was so difficult for me to understand what he was requesting and that it was just plain “common sense”. I told him he was being very rude and unprofessional. He laughed, denied being rude, and just kept repeating that it was just common sense. I asked to speak to whoever was above him and he said he was as high as you can go. At that moment I told him to delete both my account info and my father’s, and that we would no longer be instacart customers or recommend instacart to anyone. In his own words, leaving instacart was just “common sense”. Beware of this company. Use at your own risk."

I have tried to use it 3 times as of today. The 1st time, I was messaged the order would be late. I waited and the driver showed up with my groceries. Yesterday I ordered groceries again. About the time they should have been delivered I got a text message from Instacart saying they were running late and would be here within an hour. I called their customer service number to cancel my order. I did not have time to wait an additional hour. They tried to charge me a $50 cancellation fee on a $75 grocery order. I told the phone rep that 1) no where in their billing agreement is there anything about a $50 cancellation fee and 2) This was their fault. They said delivery in 2 hours not 3 hours. Then today, I tried again. I placed my order ~ again with a 2 hour delivery window. 90 minutes later I check my Instacart app and my order is still sitting in the ""order submitted confirmation"" queue. I called Instacart again. As I am on hold, I get a text message saying they are running 60 to 90 minutes late. The customer service rep comes back on the phone to let me know there are no Instacart shoppers available to shop my order. Its not like I live in some remote location ~ I am in the suburbs of Los Angeles. Instacart is a miserable excuse for a delivery service. I asked for a refund of my Express Membership fee and was told it would be prorated because I used it 3 times; I explained to the rep that I tried to use it 3 times but only was successful in having groceries delivered once. DO NOT USE INSTACART UNLESS YOU WANT TO THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY ON A WORTHLESS DELIVERY SERVICE AND BE ANGERED IN THE PROCESS."

They will use store loyalty cards to get a lower price, and then pocket the savings instead of passing them along to the customer (the person paying for those groceries)! They will offer several delivery timeframes, and then not meet them, regardless of what day you choose or time of day. I’ve tried them all, and every time they have to email me to say they won’t make the chosen delivery time. They have terrible customer service, generic responses that don’t answer your concerns, and refuse to refund you for most errors. Many of the shoppers don’t know how to pick out fresh food because they’ve never shopped for their own groceries. The fruit, vegetables, and meat selections are mediocre. They don’t care to look at the expiration dates, so I’ve received several items that were expired or expiring within a day. I’ve received smashed bread, bruised fruit, busted biscuits, and rotten strawberries. My last order had refrigerated fermented food, and it was hot by the time I received the food, so it was bad. It felt like the groceries were sitting in the car for an hour, which is also the reason the can of biscuits exploded. They also use a tipping method, which is completely ludicrous. It’s awkward at best, and you’re having us tip people who are facing things that are out of their control, like: store is out of items, Instacart doesn’t have enough shoppers, traffic, and so on. Why would you have tips for this? USPS, FedEx, and UPS do a better job and they don’t have tips. Instacart is a good concept, but bad execution on the business side. Never again."

After 4 days and 2 reminders that they had yet replied, I got a reply email telling me that they don't honor store receipt. Understood, but that doesn't explain the overcharge on pears. The total diff between the store receipt and the Instacart receipt was $20.47. My guess is most people don't have time to check their receipts and Instacart uses that as their business model.

This treatment is very hurtful. This company let me down today in the biggest way. I am in an area that is preparing for a horrible storm. I woke this morning early and put an order at 9:30 AM EST. Publix reached out to me around 11:30-AM to let me they ran out of water and flashlights. I called your customer service to have them cancel it. I placed another order right after, it gave me EST for delivery for 1-2 hours. At 12:40 I received an email saying my order will not be here until 3:45-4:45PM. At that time I called customer service, the agent was not helpful. I explained to him the urgency and why I placed my order so early, he would not do anything to make sure my order would be here at the promised time of 1-2 hours VS, the 5 hours, I gave him options of what he could do and all I go was NO, I asked to speak to a supervisor. I was put on hold and he came back and told me his supervisor was busy at the moment, but he would put a request for him to call me in 15 minutes, this was at 12:45 PM. It is now going on 5:20-PM no call from a supervisor and I just got a call from the shopper that everything on my list is out of Stock. I called back and requested to speak to a supervisor only to get a corporate number. I finally got a supervisor on the phone, I had to literally tell her the steps to take to get an order process. Again only for her to tell me it's to late, if I had mentioned this earlier they could have helped, they won't have anymore deliveries until Tuesday, 5 days later. She said if I can't wait i can got to the store myself, i explained to her AGAIN I can't because I'm disabled and pretty much home-bound. I work from home and pretty much have everything I can delivered. She said it was was just a suggestion, I told her what's the point of the suggestion, this is the reason I have this service. She told me she CAN'T give me a number or email for corporate. But she transferred me to the escalation department. Got someone else on the phone from the ""escalation department"" I had to explain the situation from beginning to end. She laughed at me and said there's nothing I can do and offered me a 20.00 credit on my next order. I hung up and decided I want no part of this company any more."

The 1st order which was a test run to see how the service would be was great. It was a small order and the store is only a mile away so they delivered within in the time frame with the items ordered, no substitutions. The second time was a larger order  ($100) The delivery guy came to the door with someone else's order and name but according to him my address was listed. When I told him it was not my order he argued and kept trying to get me to look at his phone stating insta cart gave him that order to this address. I need reading glasses so I couldn't read his phone if I wanted to, which I didn't. I told him I had $100 grocery order that consisted of mostly frozen items and I wanted to know where it was. He kept talking about insta cart must have made a mistake, he said he had no idea where my order was and when I asked him what I needed to do now to find out what the heck was going on he said ""I don't know"".  WHAT!!! He didn't know?? How incompetent and ill informed are these people. He left with the small order he had brought.  I had to go look up a store number to call and they put me on hold for 10 minutes while they contacted insta cart to find out what was going on. Finally the same delivery guy came back to my door with ""my"" order. He asked me to go through the entire order to make sure it was correct before he left. I asked him, ""Did you have this order in your vehicle the first time you came to my door?"" He said yes! He stated they send them out with two orders at a time. The other order he brought first actually belonged to the other person he was delivering to. I said, Well then why in the world didn't you realize the two orders must have gotten switched and tell me that you would go back to your vehicle and get my order instead of me having to call and waste my time trying to figure it out? He said nothing in response. Are these delivery people sooooo clueless that that can not problem solve anything for themselves? He evidently had to call insta cart and spend 10 minutes on the phone for them to tell him to switch the two orders while I was spending 10 minutes on my phone before it got figured out. In the mean time my frozen items aren't staying that frozen! That's just wrong!! No apology or anything to acknowledge the screw up either. Not acceptable!"

On weeks where I need items from there, I also order most of my groceries at the same time. It's not super convenient to get there by public transport so I was excited when I found out about Instacart. Unfortunately, they are simply not willing or not able (or both) to provide the service they claim they will. Roughly half of my orders have had missing items - not items that were out of stock but items the shoppers claimed they found and that I was billed for but that mysteriously didn't make it into shopping bag. This latest order, in addition to a critical missing item, also had the wrong variety of another item. I'm a pretty understanding person and we all make mistakes, but unfortunately with Instacart if the shopper screws up your order, there's basically nothing you can do. You can't get hold of anyone, and using their website interface to report a problems is virtually useless. They will promise to refund you but not follow through, and forget about getting any sort of additional credit for the inconvenience of them screwing up. Last time it took me about eight emails to get a refund issued. The other problem I have with them is they send me emails promising a promotional credit (such as free delivery or x amount off an order), not related to missing items, these are more general promotions, but then when I go to order, there's no way to actually claim it. In any event, I'm done. I will spend the time to send them another eight or ten emails to get a refund for this latest screw up, and then I'm out. It's just not worth it."

The first order was over an hour late, and there were mistakes made.  (Regular instead of decaf coffee, product over 1 month expired.)  But she tried hard and I gave it another shot.  The next order was much bigger, so I assumed they'd adjust for that.  Wrong!  My delivery preference time was 9pm.  My groceries didn't arrive until after MIDNIGHT!  I kept getting alerts from the shopper who was substituting products we didn't want, even though I picked replacements for those I did and specifically messaged the driver to say please don't make replacemements.  The messages stopped around 10:40 when instacart sent us a message saying our groceries were delivered.  But they weren't!  At 11:30 pm I called the 1-888 number to find out where my groceries were (you can't contact your driver while they're in checkout), and they said the system shut down at 10:30 and deleted the rest of my order and with it, my address.  So she had to call my driver to find her, and she had been hanging out with my groceries for over an hour with no idea where to go!  They asked if I wanted the groceries to ""spend the night"" at her house and be delivered the next day.  Think about it... Over $400 of your groceries, already thawing because it's been 3 hours since she shopped the freezer area, now overnight in a stranger's house that you can't vouch for their cleanliness or reputation.  No, thank you!  When I complained, the company offered me a $10 credit.  I laughed out loud.  They then offered me a $50 credit, but unfortunately it means I would have to place another order with them to redeem it.  No way.  I told them I would tell the world about their horrible service and company.And pay close attention to the pricing.  My original order was over $500.  Because she couldn't find some items or substitutions, my final bill came to $411 before I had to tip.  But when I got my receipt, only $361 of groceries were purchased.  (And no, it's not because of the club card.  They used a number different from my own, so I could see the discounts but got none of the savings, and the discounts were not reflected on my final bill.)  So the prices were $50 higher on instacart than if I had gone into the store myself.  This company is a poorly run ripoff.  If you want to feel like you're in a bad beta trial, choose instacart.  Myself, I'll keep choosing delivery pick up at Walmart and Fred Meyer."

I scheduled the delivery in order to be at my place right on time to feed my baby. Well, I placed the order at 5p and since it would take about 2h to be delivered, I went to put my baby for her nap. Very well. I got my phone around 5:40 and Instacart is calling me saying that the lady is downstairs trying to get in the building. Right next to the gate there’s the leasing office that could’ve also opened the gate for her. Ok. She couldn’t wait 5 minutes to see if someone would open the gate or maybe try to get in touch with me? I mean, this is ridiculous. Anyway, she just left! I kept replying her messages and talking with instacart team members to get in touch with her and she just vanished!

Therefore, it is imperative that the employee be able to understand and speak English. While I greatly appreciate people's efforts in learning English, if you cannot effectively communicate with the customer when you're required to, you should not be an employee there. In this particular experience leading me to write this review, not only was my order 2 HOURS late, it was sent to FOUR DIFFERENT SHOPPERS after the order was already bagged and completed the first time. Because of that, the order had to be redone multiple times. The final time the order was placed, over half of my order was wrong, I paid more for items NOT in my order, and the majority of the notes went ignored because the shopper did not understand simple English. This is not the first time something like this has happened, where my shopper did not speak English and screwed up my order, but this was certainly the worst experience I've had with a delivery service and I will no longer be using Instacart because of it."

My delivery directions are: Please leave the groceries in front of the garage door. I have 4 huge dogs so it’s easier that way. Today I opened the garage door as soon as I received the text that my delivery person was en route. I sat in there waiting and waiting and waiting until I received the standard text to rate the experience. I promptly called Customer Service to get the girl to go back to the wrong address while she was in the neighborhood and pick up my stuff that was sitting in a typical summer downpour. Well that didn’t go over well. At all. In fact the CSR told me that I was being unprofessional and she would have to terminate the call as I was getting highly frustrated enduring the scripted niceties...while trying to get her off the call to go catch the driver .  In the end, they reordered the entire order instead and I had to wait for another delivery. The dumbest system ever. With business practices like this I don’t expect they can keep taking losses for too much longer. So dumb. So, so dumb.One more thing.

After about 5 minutes of asking them if they are admitting that they cannot do anything to remove a fraudulent account they capitulated and said that they would ""look into it"" if I could send them my account information.

My job is dealing with barely speaking and non-English speaking patients to give them proper medical care. Your team member’s lack  of communication skills was unacceptable. 3.  Requested a manger who then put the call on hold. Before doing so stated he would be right back. After more than 12 minutes on hold the call was terminated. 4. Once I informed the third person I attempted to clear up the issue with I would be calling the local police department the delivery arrived five minutes later. 5.  We were told the reason for the turn around was due to GPS issues. The driver and no representative from Instacart communicated the GPS issue in any form. No call, text, or email. We watched as the estimated delivery time increased for 17 minutes to over a hour away.

Yet they suddenly ask for my drivers license picture and credit card picture. Why would I ? Im not your employee, just a customer.  And if I didnt have a credit card on file, why would there be a ‘suspicious activity’?  Also when I asked all this to the rude employee he emailed ‘Your account cannot be reactivated at this time’ What? No explanation, No nothing. Bye, I won’t use your services and let everyone know that instacart is very suspicious and they have a rude representative. If instacart charges my card I will call my bank for fraudulent usage.EDIT: YES THEY DOUBLE CHARGED MY CARD.

It was supposed to be delivered at 2pm-3pm I got an email saying they were “running late” and to expect my order around 3:30pm, I waited until 5pm and it still never arrived. At that point I called and ended up cancelling the order to which was informed I didn’t even have the option to get someone to pick the order and then pick it up myself. So after an hour last night of carefully doing a grocery list apparently I had wasted my time. The reasoning behind this was that they didn’t have anyone available to pick and deliver the order. This makes 0 sense to me as I had picked a time and had given my credit card information to complete the payment for it to be carried out as well as given my location so if this service doesn’t pertain to me why was I given the option for it? Am I missing something here, and even if it wasn’t available why wasn’t I notified? What would of happened had I not called in? Would I ever have received my order? I don’t know. I can tell you that as a first time user I am more then dissatisfied and plan to let my friends know what a joke this company is. Oh and also they up the cost of everything on your grocery list so you end up paying way more then if you just went to the grocery store. Y’all don’t even deserve one star."

I kept seeing things canceled on my list that were basic items that no store should “not have”. After waiting 30 min past the hour window it was supposed to be delivered I finally called their customer service line. Turns out their “shoppers card barcodes” don’t work a lot, and when they don’t it automatically cancels your whole order (even after my card had already been charged). Now I have to wait for the charge to go from “pending” to clear for them to even be able to refund me within 3-5 business days for the money that I can’t touch. Kroger was at least professional enough to add a $30 credit for when I go into the store to shop myself. I will NEVER use this app again."

Neither instacart nor the person delivering gave me a receipt even though I had asked for it. It was a pain to ask for a receipt at Kroger because they said they were not really in charge of it. Instacart sent me back to Kroger  saying they could not help me with it. When I finally saw the items that had been purchased listed in my account ( still no  receipt) I found out that the delivery person must have gone on a shopping spree. It listed two spa items that I had not ordered nor did I receive them. When pointing that out to instacart they kept ignoring this issue. Additionally items not available were replaced unacceptably. Veggies were not even close to being weighed at the requested weight and special instructions on certain products ignored. Customer service is a joke and so is the whole service. Don’t waste your money because you think it’s more convenient. You are better off with shopping yourself or pick up service.

I called and got some credited back but other times I wouldn’t catch them charging me for things they gave me in exchange for another one or didn’t give me but claimed they did.

I have just gotten well so now I am having to contact their Leadership to get my refund. I know it has to be around $100. I live in a house with a lot of people so everyone had their own accts. It was my turn to pay for groceries so we used my card but on each persons acct. They only signed up because it sounded like a good idea. I also didn’t want to pay a service fee before I knew how good their service was. Yet I still got charged service fees on many of the orders when it was a “free 14 day trial”. DO NOT USE unless you like paying for items you either didn’t order, are melted, in bad condition (about to be spoiled veggies n fruit) or items you were charged for but never got. I also forgot to mention that THEY WILL NEVER HAVE YOUR DELIVERY WITHIN THE TIMEFRAME SELECTED. I am a shopper as well for other companies so I know how this works.

First, they up the price of every item, they charge you delivery fee, service fee, and tip. I know the idea is to pay for some of the convenience, but they really take your money in every way. You end up paying about $40 additional after delivery. When you order, shopper says they can't find the item and replace it with an item that is double the price of the original. Every time I ordered at least 4 items doubled in price. So why list those items, if you don't have them? Then they say you can substitute, but even if you say you don't want substitutes, and write special instructions for items-to not substitute if above original price, shoppers still do it. Result, your bill is at least $25 above original bill, then they offer to waive your delivery fee of $3. Wow! Awful customer service, no real interest in listening to customer and providing them with what they asked for, including honest customer service, but instead their interest is to make as much money from the customer, in every way possible. Not falling for it again."

I was given the play by play of the shopper's trip through the store and was expecting delivery within ten minutes. I received a call telling me Kroger's registers were down, and my entire order was canceled. The concession was that I would get my money back. First of all, why do they need registers when I've already paid online? Simple math could be used to figure out how much to credit me for items out of stock. I was told the shopper who had my order finished could not wait because other deliveries had to be made. Apparently those deliveries were more important than mine, although mine was obviously first in line. To say that I would receive my money back  - which I still haven't  - is ludicrous! Of course I'm not paying for an order I never received. This was my first and last time trying to use Instacart, and I highly recommend you don't even bother trying it!"

Shopping there was not available for a couple of days while they made the move (I found this out myself after spending hours doing research).   your order delivery times reflected the unavailable times but gave no reason why and your reps had no clue. should have a flag somewhere on your service to notify customers and reps there are special circumstances, so they sound professional and knowledgeable.

Ordered a 24 pack of pepsi which was $9.99 but they were having a sale of x2 24 packs for $4.99 each so the shopper tried to message me about it and when she was unable to get ahold of me just added it on since it was a better deal for a slightly lower cost. But the shopper manually entered pepsi 4.99 x24 instead of 24 pepsi 4.99 x1. So that ended up throwing on $4.99 x24 = $119.76 plus the increased tax from this, plus a now $15 deposit fee. Instacart not only charges you early, they charge you a little more than the total to account for adjustments, so for a $60 order I was charged over $200.When I called I got someone who simply could not comprehend what was going on. It was the most infuriating experience I have had in awhile as I stared at the actual store receipt trying to dispute that the instacarts version was wrong. Not only did this create other problems for me, it was long and slow to fix, and I ended up giving up and taking a smaller refund because of their incompetence because of medical issues(why I was using their service in the first place).

Order was 2 hours late and I spent 45 minutes on the phone with the shopper because the store had none of the products it had listed on the website. I should have known after that mess they have no idea what they are doing. This will not save you any time!"

Last week I was finally able to select some hours that were available for this week. Today was supposed to be my first day to work a 2-5 shift. I got a notification that 1/2 hr before my shift I would receive information about where I was supposed to go. By 2:00pm when I had not received any notifications I reached out to Instacart help and asked when I would be notified about my orders and where I needed to go. I was told ""all you need to do is be available in your zone. A lot of people head to a busy parking lot and wait for orders."" In the meantime, my battery is decreasing rapidly from 1:30-2:00 as it is ""tracking my location"" At 2:00pm the app changed to ""looking for orders"" and by then my battery was at 18%! At this point, I knew that even if it happened to find me an order in the next few minutes I would not have enough battery life to be able to communicate further with Instacart through the app regarding receiving an order, scanning grocery store items, etc. So I decided to cancel my hours and the other 6 hrs I had taken for that week. I cannot believe how completely inefficient their system is!  I knew there was a lot of bad reviews but thought maybe my experience would be different! No such luck!"

I have spent too much time and energy trying to get money back from overcharges (especially overused bags, i.e.. putting ONE item in a double bag - you have to pay $0.10 per bag in CA) and fighting with the service and their shoppers.  The functionality and service has gone super downhill for the past 6 months and when I tried to cancel within days of my auto-renew, they have refused.  My mother accidentally placed ONE order within days of the renewal (because she didn't know about the problems) which is their excuse for charging me $99 for 12 months of service that I will not use for 360 days out of the contract.  All customer service does is send you canned e-mail answers and don't bother to actually read your messages.  Just came to find out that the 'service fee' (or something along those lines) that was on every order I had for the first 6 months or so was 'optional' and I could have opted out although it did not appear to be an option and no one ever said you could.  That fee is now gone, but I probably lost $100 over the span of that time."

https://ca.trustpilot.com/reviews/5ce00e50a843690ac8c0baf3,Kate Rishoff,1 star: Bad,Not worthy to have Publix in your name....horrific service,"Hello....I am going to be  very candid about my horrific Instacart experience(s)  not just once,  but three times.  As the old saying goes,  three strikes and you are OUT,  and trust me INSTACART is OUT in my book.  I felt that I was being a very good and patient person for giving them the two additional tries..Rather like a teacher in school giving a kid two outs before they go to the Principal's office, but truly?  I want to ROAR with laughter (not in a good way, )  when I see the ads for Instacart with the clean cut guy coming to the door with the fresh pressed green apron and the family smiling around the table.  That my friends...is the genius of advertising to make Instacart look good.    What it should really look like is a family with their tongues hanging out of their head with hunger and thirst before they arrive, a disheveled looking delivery person who doesn't even bother to comb their hair or shave,  and has NO INDICATIVE clothing that they represent Publix at all..  George Jenkins would be mortified having two of the delivery people show up at my door the way they did.    But trust me,  the bad service actually starts with the shoppers, and I think it has to do with the store itself at 33433 because even as a customer in that store,  the service is nasty and crabby to be honest...how could I possibly expect the Instacart Service to be acceptable.     Let's see....Ummm.  Three deliveries ago I had a person who could not speak English to me,  was rude on TOP of not being able to communicate effectively.    When you push the button to say that your order is final,  they write a disclaimer saying that your frozen items will be kept in a temperature controlled bag so that you get it in good condition (arrives in an acceptable manner.)   Well,   that guy  brought my things in regular plastic Publix bags such as those at the end of the register that a bagger uses to bring out to your car.    My ice cream, butter,  and pot pies  (the crust on the top you could put your thumb through when it arrived to me  that is how thawed out it was.  My ice cream  you could pour it out into a glass and make a milkshake when it arrived to you,  you didn't need to add any liquid to have that happen.   I told the driver that,  and all he could do was shrug  and tell me that he had two deliveries before me..  WHY  WERE MY THINGS NOT IN A TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED BAG?  I called the 1-800 service number  and all they offered me was to send someone back out...  MY DINNER WAS IN THIS ORDER and I was so hungry  I told them that they were out of their mind and I was not going to wait another two hours to have them turn around to fix their mistake that should not have been made to begin with if it had been packaged correctly.  Not only that,  but  I had detergents in with food items..  Tide in with my Raisin Bran...I remember this distinctly.  Food was not with Food..   Chemicals were not with other Chemicals...    Round Two,  when I decided to give Instacart another try,   I had this time a shopper  who messaged me every 30 seconds to say that she was replacing something...I mean it..  every thirty seconds.....I measured it precisely by the t.v. show I was watching  that the show would have an ad,  I would get one message...  the ads were not over yet,  and I got another message to say that she was replacing something else.   This shopper was clearly in a hurry with what she wanted to do after this shopping assignment was done... she had a date... a nail appointment,  Happy Hour at Flanigans  I don't know, but her mind was NOT on my order...  she messaged me CONSTANTLY to say that she had to replace something...she just wanted to get out of the store.  How do I know this?   Okay....  I called Customer Service  I told them the above that she was doing this throughout the store,  and again they offered no  ....solution....  so I had them cancel the order....  I went the VERY NEXT DAY  when the STORE OPENED at the same location that my shopper would have been to,  I went with my list  of the things that I wanted because I took it off my order on the computer.  .....I went through every aisle  and FOUND EVERYTHING I WANTED without substitutions...there was no need..I found every item on my list in that store....without having to ""replace"" or substitute a blessed thing.  No excuse... That shopper clearly did not want to do what she was doing..... no excuse.     Strike Three:    This laSt time... not rhetorically speaking...this was the last... ever!!...From the time that my phone ""dinged""  to tell me that my driver was on their way I called my gatehouse..because it gives an estimate of the time that it will take for your driver to get to your destination...that indicator said 10 minutes...which makes sense from Garden Shoppes to me...that estimate is right by computer standards.....  I called the Gatehouse and said that they would be there shortly......  45 minutes later...my driver arrives.... I said to myself before they got here....  ""They have my ice cream.....I can't wait to see the condition of this order.""   He gets to my door...  This delivery person looks like he SLEPT in his car...his appearance is horrific .... no shave....his hair is uncombed...  I look down  where he had the PAPER BAG (a regular standard Publix brown paper bag... and in it was my ice cream....  I said  (oh I was furious...I had wrote everything in comments...please keep my ice cream and frozen items in a temperature controlled bag.""    The shopper said ""We always do that...but I am not your delivery person, I am only your shopper..... but they do that anyway.""     Really...  really>   I said to the delivery person..  ""YOU GIVE ME THAT BAG... ""  Never mind...I took it off the GROUND  where he had it  (not like the delivery guy on t.v.  who is smiling and handing it to at the door,  you're not reaching to the damn ground as the customer to get it.... that ad is a JOKE and an insult to the consumers intelligence...take it off t.v.  its misrepresentation  all the way...)  and I said ""You stand right there..... ""    I took it into my counter... I squeezed it...and both my Ben and Jerry's and Breyers  where SLOP...SLOP... total mush..  I had the delivery guy feel it,  and he shrugs his shoulders.   I said ""Where is your temperature controlled bag?""    He said ""My What?""  I said ""YOUR TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED BAG that you put freezer/frozen items in...""I don't even know what that is...they never told me about anything like that.""   ""You don't know what that is?"" ""No they don't tell us anything like that...  Listen Lady  I had three deliveries before you....""   Well that's just all wrong right there.   He just uttered the magic words of the entire transaction..  He went around to three other places before my place...  The estimate was 10 minutes,  and he took 45.... and he didn't have my frozen in a temp controlled bag because he didn't know what it was.  and and and with all that,  I was his Fourth Delivery...... He didn't bring my water inside the house  he had it on the other side of the doorsill that I had to pick up myself and I have an Emotional Support Animal it is very difficult for me to go to a store to shop,  I try to alleviate this issue by using Instacart,   so there's another thing added on to this travesty of a service.... I called the Customer Service Line for Instacart yet again....  THat person tells me that they can come out, pick everything up,  and bring back a new order.   I HAD BEEN WAITING NOW THREE HOURS FOR THIS ENTIRE DEBACLE   AND THEY WANT TO REPEAT THAT?  I WAS FAMISHED...MY DINNER WAS IN THIS ORDER... which was the Pot Pie  (Marie Callenders)  and I didn't even need to wait for it to thaw, because that was done for me.      My butter was on the way to getting soft...on the way to it....but the top of my other pot pie you could put your thumb in it  (again,  like my order from above a few months ago  on my first go round... )  and you could feel the crust go down under your thumb....   The delivery person did not apologize at all...not one bit... not an iota,  his only thing he had to say leaving was that he had three people ahead of me before he walked away from me....before I bent down to get the 24 pack of Zephyrhills water inside the foyer.....    The Super Bowl ads were a scream to me,  and not in a good way,  I'm being completely facetious when I say that... Again...another happy smiling  guy with a clean pressed Publix Apron...   and the party was still in full swing when the guy got there and nothing was thawed out.  Trust me,  with any of these delivery people?     They need a class....they need a class on what they're doing.....No one  No one should be offered over the phone...okay  ....for an order to be picked up as a consolation...it needs to be done right to begin with..... from the word Go.....  you got the wrong person when it comes to writing a review because I am a Product Liability Paralegal,  and I pay attention to service every day in my job.   Something has HAPPENED to this service that  needs to be paid attention to.....  These people need to be able to 1) Communicate Effectively and not shrug their shoulders as an answer  2) Not be half a-----ed when it comes to what they are doing  (when I went to the store and found everything the next day after being told they needed to substitute  every thirty seconds....)  and just plain LOOK BETTER in the process.  To be honest...  Publix SHOULD be hiding the name of their apron or not wear them at all, because this is not the Publix service I know...  George Jenkins would stir in his grave.. maybe he is....   to have this happening...  They are representing  Publix...my God.... I am appalled....   My closing argument before the jury?   Inefficient,  Inept,  Uncooperative, Impolite,  UNSATISFACTORY on every Level....   (Shaking My Head)    The Defense Rests.... Have your lawyer call my lawyer...."

I ordered from one store and paid for one hour delivery. I was notified via the app that my order had been shipped for and was out for delivery. After awhile I check the app because my stuff hadn’t arrived yet and see that the shopper is parked at a completely different store...weird...but maybe they’re just driving by? 15 minutes later they’ll still there...now I’m concerned so I try to call customer service. I get disconnected twice before actually talking to someone. All of a sudden I get a random phone call (it’s not well over the hour delivery time). The call is from instacart telling me there was an “issue” with my order...apparently the shopper decided the actual store was too far away so went to a completely different store “after being instructed by an instacart customer service representative”. Therefore, my order had never been picked up. At this point, the original store closes in 15 minutes so there’s no way that I can receive my items tonight. I’m furious. It’s obviously their mistake. Are they apologetic? No. They offer to reimburse me the delivery fee. I tell them I want a full refund and they say they can’t do it because “we can’t refund you just because an order is late”...keep in mind I now wouldn’t be getting my order until THE NEXT DAY...are you kidding me?

This is the fourth time they have screwed up my orders in a big way.  The shoppers are the worst! Just because a person can use an app and has been in a grocery store, doesn't mean they know inventory! In the last month, I've had two shoppers removed from my account because of how badly they've screwed up.  Today, they tell me my order of $178.00 has been delivered. Really? Where? To whom? I have no groceries.  I spend 20 minutes on hold with customer support (another nightmare for another review), only to be told there is a problem with my order. So, I had to place the order again and now I'm waiting two hours for my order that should have been delivered over two hours ago.  I learned from a shopper that if the drivers do not see a tip on the order (I was paying in cash), they won't deliver your groceries, thus saying ""there is a problem"" and won't call you to tell you what the problem is.  They hire shoppers who are young, lazy or both.  They shoppers don't care about the customers.  An awful company that could have been wonderful. Forget calling the 888 customer support number, as they outsource to India and some other non-English speaking country. The reps are rude and clueless. Way to go, Instacart!"

This business has nothing in place to stop their shoppers / contractors from stealing from consumers. It is my opinion that our shopper John stole our groceries. With no best practices in place to stop this from happening it will continue to occur."

I work from home, so instead of having a full time car I take part in a car sharing program. I became a paid member at Instacart at $99 for a year because not having to go and get groceries seemed like an excellent way to cut down on my car usage. I placed an order on 4/2/19, a Tuesday morning and got my items delivered in the afternoon. Instacart automatically authorizes a payment of 10-15% more than the amount to cover any adjustments or ad ones that might occur during shopping. My total came to $144.94 and was adjusted in my bank account from $170 shortly after receiving my groceries to reflect the final charge. However, that was not the final charge, because they ran my card again for another $144.94 that evening. I have been on the phone with my bank to try and stop this payment, I called Instacart to ask what happened, and I wrote about 6 different emails with documentation of the double charges only to be ignored and dismissed. I didn’t get an apology or even an explanation as to why this might have happened, and I am still minus an extra 144.94 from my bank account now 2 days after the order has been placed. I will be canceling my membership and moving on to better routes for groceries, but before that wanted to let others know the dangers of using this company. They could easily leave your bank account in the red with these kinds of mistakes that they won’t even admit to or apologize for.

There is nothing on there end that they do for you they just send out a notification saying oops unfortunately they’re running behind. Well after talking with a shopper and voicing my concern I found out that the shopper didn’t get the list until right around when they sent out the “unfortunately” text.

I understand that that total will change due to produce wight. I was charged a delivery fee and $9.57  for cheese that should have been only $4.79. They said they would refund me $2.39 for cheese mistake.  Nothing for delivery fee. I called then to speak to someone I explained why would I pay $3.99 for deliver fee when they have a free trial and that was the only reason I tried them to start with. He said he would refund $5.00.

I have used it 3 times in the last month. Every time they made major errors. They brought me milk that was out of date, for instance (what was that even doing on the shelf, btw?). The buyers have ignored the ""replacement option/don't not replace"" settings that I submitted with the original order. They have ignored my real-time responses when they ask if they can substitute an item (my response is nearly always NO). Tonight the delivery person simply failed to pick up at least a bag or two of fresh vegetables and also substituted a meat product that I had said I would not accept as a substitute. When I spoke with Instacart today, the agent said that they do not provide any training to the people who shop and deliver for them. Instead, the shoppers and delivery people are independent contractors. There was not even any way for me to give the shopper a rating. It took nearly two weeks for a refund from the first order. The deliveries do not include receipts so I can't even verify prices."

https://ca.trustpilot.com/reviews/5c78996f97afa10630aec7a6,Scott Justman,1 star: Bad,Disappointment,"My family has used Instacart for approximately 30 days.  A close friend who lives in South Carolina recently lost her father very suddenly. As we live in Colorado we were questioning how can we show our love and sympathy and decided in the days following the funeral we would send a complete meal via Instacart to the family.  We placed the order 7 days in advance, to feed a family of 4 including two children under the age of 5 as well as their recently widowed mother.   On the day of expected delivery we received notification that the delivery was running approximately 30 minutes late and rather than a 3:30 PM delivery it would be closer to 4:00 PM - ok no worries.   At approximately 6:00 PM we received notification that the delivery had still not arrived.  The family that we had attempted to take stress off of was now sitting at 6:00 PM with two young children and no meal.   Not only did we now add to their stress, we were naturally embarrassed. We contacted Customer Service with Instacart and explained the situation.   The service staff member explained that unfortunately they simply did not have a driver in that area and they would be unable to complete the order.  When we asked why would they not have at least notified us if they didn’t have a driver so we could make other plans ... the answer was “some times life happens”.   Yes, life does happen ... so does death and because of that we look to companies and services to help make life easier in times of need.  A company who’s slogan is “to solve incredibly hard problems to create an experience for our customers that is absolutely magical”.  At this point in the conversation we asked to speak to a manager... we were connected and the gentlemen apologized for the error.  He explained that we were speaking to their National Office and unfortunately they had no control over their regional operations.   Ok ... things were not improving.  They explained they would be happy to cancel the order and not charge us .... really the order that was already 3 hours late that we placed a full week in advance and no one contacted us to tell us there was an issue until after the schedule delivery time???  I would hope I am not being charged.   After looking into the situation we were contacted by management who explained they would be delivering the order the following day if we still wanted to purchase the items.  Additionally, due to the confusion they were happy to extend us a $10 credit.   I’ve been personally in customer service my entire life and unfortunately this situation went from bad to worse.  While simply looking for an apology and and a solution this was never offered but yet only met with excuses and defense.    While we believe the concept of Instacart is solid, it is our opinion there appears to be significant flaws in their independent contractor model and obviously their service team.  The short falls of Instacart and their staff training not only caused us as the customer extreme embarrassment but also caused an already grieving family additional stress.    A $10 credit is a little more of an insult than a solution."

I use services like Instacart so I don't have to deal with the uneducated, brain-dead slow incompetent people who work at grocery stores nowadays. Service across the board has become unbearable over the year. It's sad when one finds out there's no escape from such horrible service! I ordered from Ralph's via Instacart. I edited my order and chose ""Do Not Replace"" for 14 of the 15 items. The moment the shopper began putting together the order, I began getting bombarded with numerous texts regarding the items she replaced. I texted the shopper and told her not to replace the items. I further asked her why she was replacing items when the order specifically states not to replace them. She stated the order did not say that. We ordered Cheese Whiz...I know gross for the celery and crackers. Supposedly Ralph's did not have it (we know they did), so the shopper decided to replace it with Tostitos Cheese Dip. What a brain-dead person! Considering the bad and ignorant behavior of that laborer, we drove to the Ralph's store where she compiled the order and sure enough we found the Cheese Whiz she claimed did not exist. On every single order I place via Instacart, there is a specific instruction on it (saved for all orders) stating ""Intercom Code 051"". The illiterate laborer did not bother getting out of her car and instead told Instacart she could not reach me. I received a text from Instacart stating she was waiting in the front because she could not reach me. I knew this was b.s. This is the standard behavior of lazy, sub-par laborers today. I went to the entrance area and the first thing I did was type 051 on the intercom system and sure enough my cell rang; so in other words, it worked. The entire time, the sub-par laborer was sitting in her car. I signaled her; pretty much letting her know I'm not moving another foot. She was the most ghetto, brain-dead, lazy laborer I've dealt with. I will never use Instacart again. There's no way I'm willing to pay for horrible, unreliable service and there's no way in hell I will support stupidity by using a service that hires such uneducated, ignorant people!Update: I was so angry following this review, I decided to contact Instacart via phone. I was surprised their customer service line was open on Sunday. I wasn't expecting that. I spoke to a rep and explained the situation. I could tell that when she reviewed my account, she knew I was serious seeing that I spend a minimum of $1200/month via Instacart and never complain. The customer service rep was nice and very understanding. Thank God their system saves all texts between the shopper and consumer. She was reviewing the texts and could not believe the ignorant things the shopper was stating to me in the texts. The customer service lady realized how serious of an issue this was and transferred me to their ""upper management tier"". I spoke with another lady in the ""upper tier"". I explained the situation. She was very nice and understanding. What concerned me was the lady telling me she's going to take care of the issue and have management have a talk with the employee. That employee should be fired, not warned! I strongly voiced my opinion to the rep stating that it's unacceptable to allow such behavior to occur. Customer service is an innate common sense based skill. One either has the skill, or they don't!  There's no teaching it! It's obvious that delivery person does not have the skill! The uneducated delivery person is a toxic liability to Instacart. Why in the heck would Instacart hold onto a toxic liability and risk losing an asset (customer)? I voiced such to the rep and further stated that there are many qualified people available to do the job."

I did have a problem on one order with some rotten blueberries that were refunded.  But the fees!!  You're charged a delivery fee, a service fee, and an optional tip AND a mark up on prices for all the items. Additionally, for my last order, they placed a pre authorization on my debit card for 235.00 on a 158.00 order. I noticed the store receipt in the bag was less then they charged me online, so I called Instacart customer service who told me this is because the online items in this store had a ""mark up"" and were higher than in store prices. Seriously!!! Shaws is already the most expensive grocery store in town as it is, and then an additional mark up for shopping online? Really??? My 158.00 order cost me 198.00 with fees, price markup and a 10% tip. I understand convenience costs a little more, but 40.00 is ridiculous.  I'll look for more reasonable alternatives.

When customer tips decreased over the next couple of weeks, we discovered they our tips were being decimated by Instacart who had discovered a technicality in employment law which allowed  them to steal part of the tip and supplement their payout to the shopper with it and then tell customers that the shopper got the whole tip.

We ended up in Fort Walton Beach in an AirBnB which was a save from a hellish vaca spoiled in Jacksonville. So traveling on Christmas day to the Fort Walton Beach BnB we needed to use InstaCart to get groceries quickly from the local Publix in an area for which we were unfamiliar.We thought InstaCart was an economic lifesaver.  They even advertised there were NO delivery fees, but that was just an outright LIE.  The ""delivery fee"" didn't exist, but something called a ""service charge"" most certainly did (and I doubt there is little difference between the two, except a lexical sleight-of-hand).  So InstaCart's ""service fee"" tacked on an additional 5%, which at almost $400 for a week's worth of groceries or so, was about $20!The $20 ""service fee"" also did not include the crappy shopper's ""tip"" which was also almost $20. So, for $40 in FEES (which pushed the total well over $400!) I would've just gone there myself and done my own shopping, especially since my ""personal"" shopper had to substitute half my grocery list and got most of the substitutions wrong. (They also put you on the spot, texting you substitutions that you're supposed to approve right there and then with little or no chance to vet THEIR choices.  Or they just put it in the cart anyway whether you approve it or not. This, incidentally, was how I ended up with 8 lbs of organic meat that was 90% fat-free and tasted like chewing a leather coat!)  I suppose it's also no surprise then that your ""personal"" shopper will substitute items at a higher cost to increase his tip.When I submitted a complaint to InstaCart arguing that their advertising of a ""free delivery charge"" was a FRAUD, I got the usual scripted answer from ""Customer Service"" probably somewhere in Indonesia or the Philippines, and eventually my complaint just went ignored and was never answered.So, while some might be tempted to chalk this one up to caveat emptor, it's really just a case of out-and-out FRAUD and a slimy sleight-of-hand.  Use InstaCart at your own risk. Like so many things these days -- Ebay, Amazon, etc. -- there really is no such thing as Customer Service and the companies really don't stand behind their promises, or in this case, outright LIE, nor do they really care about your complaints. So, my advice?  Don't use them!  Oh, and tell EVERYBODY about them until they go away!"

I have contacted their customer service many times in regards of this issue but got the same answer every time that ""the original receipt does not reflect the amount you have been charged"". What a crap! The original receipt does of cause not reflect the actual charge, the difference is the money this company steals from its customers.

So if you have 60 items that’s a minimum 24.00 upcharge on your bill and in many cases since Instacart also needs their profit they pad the price even more.  This is why they never give you the store receipt ; they don’t want you to know how much extra you are paying. Drivers are not permitted to give you the actual store receipt for this reason.

Again, they were telling me that the price from the store doesn’t show things like service fees and delivery fees. I advised that I am and express customer, and I do not have delivery fees or service fees, that the only correct price was the tip for the Shopper. On and on it went, with several of them telling me that there are different things that aren’t shown on the grocery receipt. I said the grocery receipt shows  what the actual charge was, and THAT charge plus the shopper Tip amount should be the only added price. After two hours I gave up, I canceled my membership, and I am contacting the Consumer Fraud Division of the federal government to file a report against Instacart.  I believe that they are actually charging people more money, the price that is on your shopping cart page when you submit it, no matter what your true price is! The Instacart total has a disclaimer which states that the total is only an approximate.  it states that prices may change for your total price based on substitutions, out of sale items, etc.  If I hadn’t been so knowledgeable about the prices I was looking for and what I could afford, and if the amount wasn’t as much,  I might not have known that they had charged me more than what was on the grocery receipt. This company is a sham, considering they say the same thing over and over again, I believe that that is how they are taught to get around the situation. It didn’t work with me and I say to anyone out there , DO NOT USE THEM!!!"

The store which usually sells Bachman brand Air-Popped Butter Popcorn has stopped carrying it for some reason so I searched for alternate ways to get it.  Instacart's website had a photo of the Bachman popcorn so I ordered 10 bags with clear instructions to NOT SUBSTITUTE ANYTHING ELSE.  When the shopper arrived to deliver my 10 bags of Bachman popcorn, he handed me 2 shopping bags, turned, and almost RAN away!  Before he got 2 feet away I looked inside the bags and immediately saw they did NOT CONTAIN WHAT I ORDERED so I called him back saying, ""Hey, where are you going? I didn't order these!""  He kept going.  I said, ""Wait!  Take these back with you - I didn't order these and I don't want them!""  He stopped, turned, and said, ""Take it up with Instacart!""  I said, ""Take these back with you!  I specifically made the notation on my order to NOT SUBSTITUTE ANYTHING!""  He said, ""I don't take things back - I only deliver things.  If you have any problem, tell Instacart, not me.""  So I contacted Instacart and they asked me to send them a photo of what I received.  I took the photo of the stuff, sent it to them, AND HAVEN'T HEARD BACK FROM ANYONE IN OVER A WEEK.  I had to initiate a ""Claim"" with my Credit Card Company and have been still waiting for them to resolve the issue.  I ordered 10 bags of popcorn and got 10 bags of corn chips of a totally unknown name brand.  My Instacart experience was a complete rip off and a nightmare!  Of course, if your shopper found exactly what you ordered and you got it, you should have no complaints but as soon as you order something that they can NOT find, they don't care that you indicated NO SUBSTITUTIONS - if they honored that, they wouldn't have been able to make the sale.  They'd rather ignore their own ""No Substitutions"" box and send anything before admitting they could not fulfill your order.  Not even my credit card company has been able to get through to them!  They have a way of ignoring all contact attempts that may result in a refund.  I can't even find a phone number for them as they ignore all email requests for attention and refund.  These 10 bags of corn chips are sitting on my floor for 2 weeks now, waiting for someone to come pick them up.  Do yourself a favor and find a more reputable shopping service."
https://ca.trustpilot.com/reviews/5c0581669d37800974cba4e4,Nneka Davis,1 star: Bad,I worked as a shopper for instacart at…,"I worked as a shopper for instacart. They do not care about the employees and they definitely do not care about the customers. I was a loyal employee-took me three hours to get to work which included 45 min walk from the train to the store I shopped at-I was an in-store shopper in Pennsylvania. I shopped for my customers as if I were shopping for myself-I was careful when selecting produce and product with expiration dates. I had 100% rating on my customer satisfaction metric, 97% on my replacements, and a low refund rating because my customers were usually happy with the my replacements. Instacart's speed metric is such that, the longer you work for them, your speed has to go down to 48 seconds per item that you pick. Which means you can forget about your shopper asking a store employee to check the stock room for your items-instacart does not allow you the time to do so. I was fired from instacart with excellent metrics across the board with the exception of the speed metric-I was only about 5 seconds short of my ""picking"" (their term!) time. It didn't matter that ALL of my other metrics were great and that I was as close as I was with my time. And it didn't matter that I was more concerned with customer satisfaction than with speed. I was one of three women whose jobs were being threatened because of speed-and ALL THREE OF US had EXCELLENT customer satisfaction, replacement and refund metrics. Those who were kept on the job met the speed metric but had extremely low customer satisfaction, replacement and refund ratings. Groceries were thrown onto shelves, some items get misplaced-like frozen items going on the shelves rather than in the freezer, or things that should go on the shelf going into the refrigerator where they would be RUINED. So instacart cares about speed and NOT about the quality of service being provided to customers.They will get rid of people who have actual real life experience shopping who know not to put bananas in the fridge, and keep the people who are fast and don't care as much about the products customers are purchasing to provide for their families. I told them in one of my reviews that, knowing what goes on behind the scenes, I would never use their service, and I stand by that. It is an awful company, both for the shopper and for the customer."

I was referred by a friend with a $20 off AND free delivery coupon code. The coupon was applied but wasn’t reflecting in the bill, so I called Instacart support. The lady told me to place the order to see if it would show up. Then when it didn’t show up, she checked with her supervisor and said there’s a new rule she was unaware of - I have to spend $35 or more for the coupon to work. It would have been nice to know that either on the coupon itself or from the Instacart employee who should know her business. She told me to cancel the order and place another one and wait a couple days for the money to be pulled from my bank, maybe it just takes processing time. I did another order for $35 and waited but nothing was applied and the order ended up over $50 after delivery and taxes. I called again and was told that I would be refunded the $20 but not the delivery because free delivery only counts on the first order. I explained that the only reason my first order was cancelled was because I was TOLD to cancel it by Instacart themselves. The man said his supervisor would have to investigate it and that I should receive an email about what’s going on. I had planned on sending a picture I took of the initial coupon to prove it had FREE DELIVERY. I received no email or call after 2 days so I called again. A lady told me there was something on my account and she was surprised I hadn’t been contacted yet. She said she was sure I’d get a response soon. A week and a half later I finally call again and FINALLY they say I can get refunded the delivery fee, only to be told then that it had been so long since the order that they are unable to refund me the delivery fee. It’s INSTACART’s fault that it took so long. They offered me a credit on my account but why would I ever place another order with this company? I left a review on my order and was reached out to be an Instacart employee, and I explained to him the situation. He told me that free delivery only applies to the first order which I already knew. The problem was my first order didn't get any of the coupon applied which is the company's fault. It's like he didn't even read what I said. He passed me off to yet ANOTHER Instacart employee who asked me to detail what happened. I again had to explain the entire situation, and she told me she had applied a free delivery credit on my account but that I'd have to spend $35 for it to work. I told her I didn't want a credit as I had stated before, especially since I've had such a bad experience. I said I would be reporting this to the BBB. After an entire week yet ANOTHER Instacart employee reached out just to say that I was already refunded the $20 for the $20 off portion of the coupon. I already knew that! I'm trying to get the money back for the delivery that was supposed to be FREE. They also tried calling me, but since it was a number I didn't know I of course didn't answer. Instead of leaving a voicemail, they called 4 times and left no messages and mentioned nothing about it via email. They called 4 times back-to-back and I had to keep ignoring the calls because I was at work. Very unprofessional."

I placed an order for a thanksgiving meal through sprouts.com. chose placed and pay! We were waiting for the food only to learn that even if you pay it is not guaranteed you’ll receive your meal. Apparently sprouts stores have been sold out of these meals for about a week and noone bothered to let the customer’s know but they will gladly take your money and make you wait. Not only do you pay for the meal itself but they add extra charges for “just incase we dont have it and need to substitute” I called every sprouts store in the area and they all said they do not have access to instacart and that they are not directly connected. I called insta cart and they give you the runaround how sorry they are. And apparently i wasnt the only one calling about this there were a few other people complaining about the same situation. So if youre going to order a holiday meal from sprouts or vons/safeway or any other place that hires this company dont order online call instead because you will be greatly disappointed paying for something and not receiving it and not even knowing it until the day of the event.

THEN she delivered my items to my front door and I asked her in person why she refunded multiple items and she stood there silently and then walked away. As I was putting away my items I was actually able to get, I noticed the bread was squished and 3 of my eggs were cracked so that made it even more irritating. I called customer service and the lady was very understanding, however, she gave me $10 credit for NEXT TIME as if I'm ever going to waste my time ordering from instacart again so that was pointless.

It was ""heck"". For one order, so many mistakes were made I had to have three shoppers. The last two were extremely sweet...and that was all that was positive. The online reps in Customer Service were confusing, contradictory, TERRIBLE in their communication. They charged me $23 something for three things in my first order, then promised me refunds for these ($5.99 for shipping, $4.54 for an unauthorized tip, $4.54 for some unknown, unexplained service fee), then said they were returning a 15℅ promised discount on the order. THEN they told me instead that they gave me a $25.00 credit to use them again! Actually, they owe me now about $40.00...but are holding my refund money hostage to shopping there again. I went thro two entire days plus time after trying to fix things, and NEVER, EVER want to shop thro Instacart again. That I am owed refunds promised and not given is theft, fraud and illegal. That they are rude, inconsistent, dishonest, untrustworthy, cheats and worse is horrible Customer Service!!! I will NOT ever use them again, nor should anyone else. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!

You all send me orders too far away. It took me over an hour to get to the first and another hour just to make the delivery due to rush our traffic and I was already far on the other side of town. Why was there no one closer to send this too?  And if rejected I get penalized. Can’t win!  I got $7.40 for two hours of work plus gas and a very small tip for this order. It cost me a quarter tank of gas to complete this order.  I got penalized for taking a break instead of accepting an order which was sent immediately after completing the first.  About the others you all sent me, again, too far.  You shouldn’t send shoppers the same order more than once if they declined it once. I refused them because 25 min to a store to shop is too far for suck little pay.  You all set us up for failure.  If our pay was a lot better the distance wouldn’t be an issue and would reduce the amount of rejections.  A customer told me that her order was reassigned three times. I assume this is why.  We get the orders to the customers and without us the company would completely shut down. We are the backbone of Instacart. We deserve to be treated and paid better and not be penalized when choosing not to accept an order that would put more money in greedy corporate pockets and pay us with less than we started our shift with. It’s completely unfair. The other day you all sent me a batch with two orders. The first delivery was about 12 min from the store. The second had ice cream and was 35 minutes away from the first customer I delivered to, plus the distance from the actual store I shopped at. Despite me putting the ice cream in my cooler bag it was partially melted upon arrival. I got blamed for that and it counted against me, not the person who poorly assigned that order.

My bad for not reading the fine print on their site, but I assumed the markup was their delivery fee, their service fee and their tip. Well I was mistakenly given the actual Costco receipt and saw that the cost of the items was $307.52, but I was charged $456.45 (a mark up of $148.93)! When I contacted Instacart about what I thought was a mistake, I was told they mark up the cost of each item as well, versus what you would pay in the store. They said this is on their website. (It is, in tiny print in a link you have to click on.). I'm all for paying for services, but an almost 50% markup to have items delivered seems unconscionable to me. I find this particularly distressing since delivery services like this are ideal for the elderly or the handicapped. Anyway, just in case you weren't aware of their policies I'm sharing.

Delivery was quick and accurate, and shoppers and delivery personnel were generally friendly. However it's become dismal and a recent series of mishaps has me so infuriated I've vowed never to use it again and will stick with Shipt. Aside from a growing number of specific item issues where something isn't in stock and strange substitutions, small forgotten items, then not being notified of substitutions until the shopper closed the order, then about 2 weeks ago, There was $150 worth of groceries left at the wrong door, then on the very next order, it took 3 tries and multiple angry emails with support and 2 phone calls to get a bag of dog food I ordered that was left out of my delivery. They were insisting on giving me a credit on my next order, but I told them there would be no next order and I wanted what I paid for at no extra cost to me. Here's the deal- I paid a %5 service charge on that $15 bag of food. The credit would have only been for the item plus tax (per support). I was told the service charge was what they use to ""provide me with the best possible service and it was nonrefundable"". Really? So if I order it again, I would pay that charge a second time on the subtotal before credits are applied, even though I only received it once. I opted for redelivery. Then the following day after making myself available for that delivery, someone came with an order- it wasn't mine. It was anything but one bag of food I was supposed to get. She was on the phone rooting through her car for awhile, then just left and the redelivery was cancelled without notice. I had to call, again, and demand, again, that they redeliver my food at no charge. I did not want a credit on a future order. So I pay more for them to mess up an order. Furthermore, because the food is only $15, I can't order it by itself without a $10 service charge, so I'd be forced to order another $20 in items in order to avoid that. So in short, mistakes are incentivized by tethering customers to make future orders and pay further service fees and tips. All to get what you paid for today. I had to speak to about 6-8 different support team members to demand they bring the food, by itself, with no cost to me. And this after they inflated their fees and yearly membership by %50 and 5% on all orders. To add a little salt in that wound, the service personnel I've dealt with were rude, accusatory, fail to understand math, give nothing more than a script without hearing your problem, make correction of those problems difficult, and if you go online they blame customers for being disgruntled and accuse clientele of complaining only to get free stuff. What I really want is a pro-rated refund of my annual membership fee. Not asking for anything I didn't pay for, I just want out. Service is dismal from what it was when allegedly they raised fees to improve the quality. Not so, Instacart."

They aren’t allowed to combine houses. There is no refridgeration involved. Packers and shoppers are paid a very low “per customer” amount so there is no incentive to get it right. To make anything approaching a living, they have to get numerous orders out per hour. No coupons, discounts, store specials are taken into effect PLUS the regular prices are RAISED. In addition, instacart might not charge you for delivery, but the stores do—something I’ve never heard of. It ends up being much much more expensive for only part of your list to arrive damaged. Very much not worth it and not ok as a business model. Also, they have a free 2 week trial, but if you  try to cancel, INSTACART WILL “LOSE” YOUR CANCELLATION REQUEST,” and you’ll end up paying the $145 anyway.

The other day my girlfriend tried instacart for herself for the first time and lo and behold, the delivery was wrong AND they refused to refund the $5 service fee. I don't know why they think she would ever try to use their service again if it didn't work the first time and they refuse to take responsibility for their mistake. Maybe they're slowly going out of business and they need the money."

I’ve used Instacart on many occasions and they had been helpful when I order heavy items I, myself, would have great difficulty carrying up the stairs to my condo. The past several times though, service had failed for multiple reasons. For instance, I ordered basic stuff like bottled water, bread, milk, etc. I use the feature that tells the shopper if they don’t have a particular brand, that it’s ok to replace with any alternative brands. Only to have a shopper refund that item, because they didn’t have any in stock. (Really??? The store is completely out of milk and bottled water??)I started to realize that now shoppers conveniently “can’t locate” the heavier items I order because I’m sure they don’t want to deal with carrying them up my stairs either. One time, I ordered, and they just left my delivery dumped in front of my downstairs neighbors yard with no communication about where my delivery was. I had to spend time calling customer service to have them track down the shopper to find out when and where he delivered my purchases. Another issue, is one time a shopper accidentally left the receipt in the bag of groceries delivered and I saw the total cost of the purchase was about $50 less than what I was charged. When I called to inquire about this price difference they told me that Instacart gets charged by the grocery store to shop there, which is why I pay more than what the receipt states. (Seriously doubt this)Instacart is just getting shadier and way less reliable and I will not deal with them any more."

They add a charge to your grocery bill that they do not clearly disclose.They added an unauthorized charge to my debit card for $33.64 onto my groceries bill which totaled $81.36, for a grand total of $115.00.  This does not include the $4.06 added to my bill at the grocery to the delivery man.  (I also tipped him $10 cash when I had not yet gone through the bags and now learned today of the added charges.)  I did not see the very light grey notice they said was on their site when I placed the order.  Their rep said it is light grey and is hard to see.  Why is it not in bold print???  Made clear?  Now they get to keep the overage for over a week until I get it refunded, if it will be. I protest their policies, and they are not cllear and I did not sign any agreement that they specified an overcharge and never given when I ordered this hidden charge. I want the ten dollar tip returned too since he did not shop at my Smiths where i placed the order as I was led to believe. Why do they ask you to state the location of your store if they do not intend to go there.The item I most wanted, almonds, I did not get since it was not available at the Smiths store nearest to the shopper, or the fig bars nor theEnerG Brown Rice Loaf. Maybe cause they did not use the store I was told to order from.  The pound of almonds is a protein source I depend on because I do not eat meat.  It was available at the store near me where he did not go but where I was told to make my shopping list.  These people are not the quality of Smith's which is very consumer friendly. I let the store know so they do not refer people to their service again. Smith's has a in store shopper service that is better and then have your store bag, then pay the store and then call Lyft  who are very reasonable to bring your groceries to your home.  Why deal with a company out of state,  who are uncooperative in answering your questions since they know you will not like to hear what they charged on my debit card. They interrupt to shut you down, have a vibration voice that she clearly could control because when she said she was hanging up because I would not let her talk, there was no vibrating.  I did not authorize the $115.00 debit, $33.64 over the actual grocery charges of $81.36 that they charged on my debit card. I did not see it until today when they  finally sent the actual receipt but still hold out on giving me the actual grocery list the man used to shop that I placed from Smiths store near me.I want receipt of my grocery list they gave the shopper since their site did not have a way to print it when order placed.  Callled Smith's who said they could not give me the shopping list since it is ""Instacarts"" who is in control of it all and although they give the impression they are involved say they have nothing to do with it, even thought they recommend using that so you can have a home delivery.Ugglly.  Never using their service, and they say I have a membership making one order and charge for that membership.  They better not take that out of the overage they billed my debit card.

It’s like Uber AND a personal grocery shopper combined. The convenience of being able to add items to your cart as you think of them, from your office and home, to submit orders for delivery is something everyone needs. HOWEVER, that’s not the reality of the process. Food is often not stored in a “temperature controlled environment” and order delivery windows are FREQUENTLY extended beyond the one provided upon maybe—making the service created in the name of convenience, well, inconvenient. The average minimum delivery window is ~2 hours in my area. It can happen at any time within that window, so it’s important to be available during the designated time. But, often, the orders are pushed back—with no explanation. Imagine if your Uber showed up 2 hours late and they just said, “my bad.”And don’t try calling customer service so you can get some insight. They are nonchalant and borderline uncaring. The poorly trained folks on the other end of the line won’t offer much, not even sympathy. Frankly, when I’m calling about my delivery not being en route, I just want an estimation of when it will be, and the response has been “I can’t really say.”When my shopper is delayed due to traffic and bails, my order is pushed to the back of the queue, with no consideration that I’ve already been waiting. When my card is charged incorrectly, I’m told the issue is resolved, just to discover that it wasnt after I hang up. You’re charged a premium for convenience: prices are higher than in store, and delivery and service fees are applied. And when you’re charged for convenience, you expect it—no exceptions. I want to love this service, but they have a lot of work to do—across the board."

We hope all others will understand there are no returns on defective items with Instacart. The picture of one of the avocados was after 11 days after delivery, and will not ripen normal.On the initial day of delivery, we failed to receive some ordered items, and instead of refunding us the same day we complained about missing items, Instacart insisted we only be given a future credit. We had to make an additional request with supporting emphasize why we want a refund to our original CC payment and not a future ""Instacart credit"". Stay away from Instacart, unless you like being ripped off, mistreated, cheated, and wasting more time writing online reviews than it takes to buy from somewhere else or drive to the store yourself.Instacart founder is Apoorva Mehta. Below is a copy and paste of a few of his Instacart indictments in only the last 2 years, which is all being bankrolled by too many ""too big to fail"" financial bail out firms to count.In March 2017, Instacart agreed to pay a $4.6 million class action settlement stemming from the misclassification of its shopper employees as independent contractors. The suit alleged 18 violations, including improper tip pooling and failure to reimburse workers for business expenses.[27] Instacart has also faced intense criticism from its workers and tech media for removing the option of its customers to tip their shopper in November 2016. Backlash against the policy forced the company to reinstate the tipping option only weeks later.[28] In November 2017, a large number of Instacart workers participated in a strike against the company, alleging wages as low as $1 an hour. Instacart claimed that the strike had no impact on its operations.[29] In February 2018, Instacart mistakenly withheld tips given from it's customers to shoppers, and blamed a ""bug."" Customers who also waived the service fee were often still charged.[30] In April 2018, Instacart instituted a controversial non-waiveable 5% service fee on all orders.[31]"

There are no actual people to contact,  they answer you unsatisfactorily and then dismiss your concerns (this is the second, albeit larger, concern I have had and neither were resolved appropriately)."

This is a very small order and the store is less than a quarter mile from my apartment so for this to take 2 hours is ridiculous. Especially since the shopper started the shop 30 mins before I called customer service. I should have just went to the store myself instead of using this service. The agent that I spoke with was not helpful. She did not care and gave an “oh well” vibe along with non answers. This was a crappy first/last experience with this company!

They delivered early before i was even home with no communication. I specifically picked a time i would be there. Earlier i wasn’t there. You can’t make returns or exchanges in store or through instacart. You pay more for the items but can’t return a thing. If they substitute without asking they give you a coupon for next use. But that is the only way to “return”.

He called the shopper who confirmed that she had delivered the groceries. He then got back on the phone with me, yelled at me and flat out accused me of stealing the groceries and continued to insist that I did so. I mean he was really yelling, I tried to explain to him that maybe the shopper got the wrong floor but he yelled and insisted that I had stolen them in an attempt to get free groceries. I was just completely shocked and offended.Turns out the shopper had dropped the off in the building next door. I went door to door in the adjacent building and eventually found them.

https://ca.trustpilot.com/reviews/5b79856b14b7d80bc0b54bae,Krys,1 star: Bad,At first it seemed like a great…,"UPDATE:  They are at Kroger now. Don't do it. Shop Kroger via clicklist instead. I do not work for clicklist, but I will shamelessly promote a great service when I see a competitor enter the market with all around subpar service. REVIEW: At first it seemed like a great idea. Especially if you are going through any physical or health hardships like I was. But it is highway robbery. Not worth it in the long run. I was able to avoid grocery shopping for a year without a major blow to my budget by piece-mealing amazon prime now and clicklist through Kroger. I'm no longer in an area serviced by prime now OR clicklist delivery. Just instacart. As it is prices are marked up, as to be expected. But Between the service fee AND delivery fee, you may already be paying about 15-20% of your order. Then they take out a small tip, which the drivers expect for you to increase to 15-20%. After all that, you should expect to be paying around 25% of your order in service charges and tip. I paid $30 once for a $120 order.   I heard from one of the shoppers once that they were only getting paid $4 for an order I placed for $100 for which Instacart was already charging me $8 in fees. They have the nerve to charge $150 for a yearly subscription. I dont pay that for amazon. And they definitely are NOT amazon. Get it together first. Not to mention they change the interface often without notifying customers. Where you go one week to tip will not be the same the next week. The app, unlike clicklist, does not keep up with what's truly in stock in the store so you could be selecting things that they never have. And their substitution selections they suggest to their shoppers aren't actual substitutions by any other shopping apps standards. They will sub you a different product under the same brand rather than same product different brand. And the shoppers tell me that's what the app suggested. Like for real??  And you can forget about a price match for a different brand like click list does. They will give you a $10 5 oz bottle of olive oil when you shopped for a $10 18 oz bottle as a 'substitute'. Who wants to pay that? The only way to cancel the substitution is to catch them while they're shopping, which they do at the speed of light, because there is a lot of pressure for shoppers to be fast I hear. Besides, if you had time or bandwidth to babysit the shoppers you'd probably just do the shopping yourself. Just skip it and shop yourself. This is workforce slavery and rape to any customers pockets for sub-par service."

Would save me a lot of frustration. Have used Instacart many times before for convenience, despite their ridiculous markups AND service fee. Placed an order tonight as feeling too sick to make a grocery store run on the way home. Order was to be delivered 9-10pm. Not my first choice but only availability. Order was confirmed immediately, but no driver ever claimed the order. At 10:15pm I decide ti cancel the order as I can no longer stay up. After lots of searching on the Instacart app a google search finally yields a phone number for customer service. Rosemary, my customer service rep, proceeds to tell me that the driver cancelled my order and issued a full refund. No Rosemary, that would be me since my delivery window passed without Instacart app seeming to give a flip. After saying her flippant sorry, there is just silence from her end. No ""sorry for the inconvenience"", no ""can I help you get this rescheduled"", nothing but the silence of crap customer service. When I point out that her response is inconsiderate to a paying customer who didn't receive the promised goods AND who had used their service multiple times in the pasr, she tells me irately that there is nothing else that needs to be done. In response to me then informing her that her customer service skills are the reason I will no longer be using Instacart, she hangs up on me. So yep, I will take my money someplace else. If anyone at Instacart ever wonders why they can't compete with Amazon, here's your answer. Good customer service is invaluable, and people will be loyal customers to businesses that treat them well in return."

https://ca.trustpilot.com/reviews/5b70755014b7d80b2400fdf9,Helen,1 star: Bad,"Dishonest, hideous, and deceiving company.","This app charges $14.99 monthly subscription fee and 5~10% of your total order as service fee. You are also encouraged to pay at least 15% tips. In addition, the unit price of each item is 10~30% higher than in-store purchase. So you do the maths what will cost you for each order! However, what makes me angry was not just the cost, I knew it very well that the unit price is much higher than the in-store purchase and since I had no other options in our area at that time, I was OK with that. What made me decide to leave this app was when my request for the original retailer receipt from Instacart was rejected. They are just so hideous and deceiving. Thankfully, Walmart now starts the delivery service. They charge $9 for each order regardless the number of items, that’s it! The unit price is guaranteed the same with in-store purchase"

I see that my experience has occurred with another victim of Instacart...Instacast claimed the delivery guy came and tried  to deliver my groceries, but I didn’t answer the door and when the delivery person tried to call me, they claim my phone number was disconnected.  This is not true.  I was home and it was late in the evening.  I checked my phone to see what time my delivery would come.  Around delivery time, my groceries never came.  Then I saw a message on the app stating my delivery was cancelled.  I assumed my delivery was cancelled because i ordered so late.  Instacart charged me $15 fee and I did not get my groceries.  I wasn’t sure why I was charged $15 but assumed it was a hold charge and waited for the charge to be reimbursed.  I eventually called Instacart a little short of a month later and inquired about the $15 and asked why I was charged and requested a refund. Instacart said I didn’t answer my door and the $15 was the charge for not being there for the delivery.  Instacart said the delivery person tried to call me but my number was disconnected. (as I mentioned above - this is not true.) I WAS home my cell number was never out of service.  I explained this to Instacart and basically I was told the delivery did come and too bad.  DO NOT USE INSTACART! THEY WILL CHARGE YOU $15 FEE, YOU WILL NOT GET YOUR GROCERIES AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A WASTE OF TIME!!  They will give excuses excuses excuses - Customer Service is not given with this company.   I was a first time user of Instacart and my experience was a big FAIL due to this company being a SCAM!   I would like a report on how many times this type of incident occurs or how often people are charged incorrectly."
