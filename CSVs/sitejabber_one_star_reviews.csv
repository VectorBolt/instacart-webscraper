https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1295,san R.,1.0 star rating,Unethical and Horrible practices to cheat customers by instacart company and shoppers,"								Terrible company and shoppers, I have very bad experience not just once but 4 times, today I got a small toilet paper roll delivered when I ordered for a large pk of paper towels for 28.99. How can anyone with brain make such poor choices unless their intent is to cheat, after spending 4 hours with various support people without refund I am better off campaigning to banish this unethical company from America								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1361,Ellen B.,1.0 star rating,Stole my money!,"								Incredibly, Instacart charged me over $95, associated with CA, but no store listed, for groceries I never purchased. I live in Ohio and have not traveled anywhere near California for years. Now, in the middle of this pandemic, as I am tight on funds, they're reviewing my case and will get back to me. Be warned! It may take me up to a week to see my money again! I won't use Instacart again! If you do, keep a careful eye on your bank account!								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1523,Nancy S.,1.0 star rating,Never Again,"								I have been using insta cart for awhile now and have had trouble in the past with them. They are the most unorganized, horrible customer service, and have NO listening skills. I had an order delivered today that had another shoppers stuff charged to my card. When I called they kept telling me it wasn't in my cart. No kidding! The shopper herself told me she billed someone else's groceries to my account. I will NEVER us insta cart again. Which means unless Kroger gets someone else I will not be using them for delivery either.								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1398,Mark H.,1.0 star rating,Authorized Hold on my credit card,"								Purchased items valued at $152.07. This amount was taken from my account on May 18th. A day later, Instacart, then place a hold for $225. Now I am told it will take 2 -3 BUSINESS days before I receive the held funds! Never experienced this type of online transaction for retail purchases, perhaps its common in the Hotel industry for reservations. Crazy!								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#955,Karen H.,1.0 star rating,Delivers warm food that should be cold,"								I placed an order that included bacon. When they delivered the order, the bacon was room temperature. Ugh! Who knows how long it was sitting out. Unlike other delivery services, they did not have it specially wrapped or anything. Disgusted. Can't even get a hold of anyone unless you want to wait 2.5 hours which is what the automatic voice said. Not even an option to have an automatic call back. I will NEVER use Instacart again.								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1342,divakar K.,1.0 star rating,Instacart price scam,"								It is almost equal to cheating. They rip the customer utilize this pandemic situation.
This service is a rip off they mark up the prices by 25%.
I purchased grocery at Costco from $342 (including tax and exclude tips) order in that actual price is 284(include tax) was their mark up. Almost 60$ more for one order i did 3 order till now. I would have payed Walmart or Amazon prime paying 12.99 and get may other benefit along with the proper items. I don't how Costco allow these kind of fraud company.								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#934,JM V.,1.0 star rating,"Instacart Doesn't Deliver, But Keeps Your Money","								Instacart was scheduled to deliver our order from Fred Meyers between 9:00 pm and 10:00 pm on 03/24/2020. At 8:44 PM we were messaged that there were delays and the groceries would be delivered by 11:30 PM. At midnight, we finally gave up waiting for the delivery. Instacart never delivered our groceries or contacted us again about the delivery. Now their website says that there is no driver listed for our order. We are working with our Credit Union to cancel payment.								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1107,Nancy F.,1.0 star rating,Read these reviews!,"								I agree with the other low raters here! I tried Instacart today for the first time, and it was definitely a bad experience! The shopper woman made several mistakes, charged me too much, and now I have to wait up to 7 days for my adjustment from the $170 the co. Automatically charges to get started. Scary to think I won't be getting this refund because of everything else negative from today! NEVER AGAIN!								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1659,John B.,1.0 star rating,Allows fraudulent purchases for hundreds of dollars to made on your account. STAY AWAY!,"								THREE TIMES I have had shoppers fail to deliver entire orders and made FRAUDULENT purchases on my account that I had to call support to have reversed. It seems this is a common scam that shoppers are permitted to carry out repeatedly without consequences. The customer service phone number sends you to email and disconnects. Horrible, disorganized, DANGEROUS company that should not be allowed to do business in the US.								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1044,Gary E.,1.0 star rating,Scammed Twice,"								I've ""tried' to use instacart during this virus epidemic to keep my family safe. First time they delivered
To wrong address and told me tough. Fortunately, I found the address and was able to get the order.
Second time, they only delivered 1/2 the order yet charged me for the full order and will not respond or
Reply. I've forwarded case to Police and Sheriff's Office for prosecution. This is fraud by means of interstate
Commerce folks. A federal felony.								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1199,Catherine K.,1.0 star rating,No Customer service response,"								I was overcharged on my initial grocery order and was charged for an item I didn't order. After contacting CS twice I still haven't heard from them. I am now past their 7 day window for refunds. Obvious that this company is overwhelmed with the current situation but if you can't handle the extra business you need to let go of it.								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1068,Jamie T.,1.0 star rating,Gone down steeply,"								I've been using the service for a couple of years, and would generally give 4 stars. However, the service has slipped to zero in the past couple of weeks. They've been busy i. E. making more money, but new hires are not being trained properly, there is no customer service by phone or online and I don't know if the site has crashed. This is new. I've been trying to follow up a complaint about wrong items delivered on April 1. Here it is April 6 and I still can not get anyone to straighten it out. Really, really bad.								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1589,Kaylen T.,1.0 star rating,Awful company to work for,"								Awful awful awful. They allow the customer to decide if you keep your job or not. The customers continually lie and say they didn't get this or that or something was damaged with no photo proof and that automatically drops the driver down. $#*! system. Terrible company. They over charge by at least 10 cents on every single item sometimes much much more. Do not spend your money here.								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1136,M S.,1.0 star rating,Bad customer service,"								Driver delivered to wrong address. No follow up from driver or instacart in the past 48 hours of my consistent reaching out. Could have been solved simply by returning and redelivering to correct address. Driver was aware of mistake within after his departure. Instacart's lack of ownership of the issue has led the elderly waiting another week for their grocery delivering during this worldwide pandemic.								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1146,samuel k.,1.0 star rating,Instacart delivered grocery to wrong address,"								Instacart shopper delivered to wrong address. I live in house. Text message showed he dropped off apartment 12. Why? Our address is 1012. He assumed last 12 is apartment number and went incorrect address and could not find right address-- rather than dragging grocery; he dropped off grocery to the stranger.
Attached picture is not my house's front porch. I complained to the website link; but no response for 7 days.
I called credit card to file a dispute claim. What a irresponsible company!
Make sure you use credit card if you have to use this company-- no paypal or venmo -- just in case.								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#893,Debbie Q.,1.0 star rating,"Double charged my credit card, & charged for items did not recieve","								1st mistake, Instacart is a third party, not affiliated with local grocery stores. Instagram double charged my credit card $210.00 for $83.00 actually spent. And I had 1 item missing that they charged me for. I ordered 43 items and they only delivered 20 items. Their prices they charge consumer are outrageous. They home up prices the actual sore prices are lower. What crooks! I will not use instacart again.								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1585,S K.,1.0 star rating,Don't use this service,"								I have used Instacart about 6 times and it is never a good experience. First, they put an estimated hold on your account even when you cancel an order. Secondly, it is so hit or miss - mostly miss about what you get. I just received ordered 12 things, three they just canceled, 2 they replaced with something else, and 4 they brought the wrong items. So of what I ordered only 3 were correct. I can't call anyone and this terrible. Last time I use them.								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1197,Sharon M.,1.0 star rating,Price Gouging or Highway Robbery?,"								We ordered groceries from Costco for delivery using InstaCart in Powder Springs GA. The markup on each item was outrageous. The shopper needlessly substituted cheaper/lesser products but the price difference was not reflected in my final bill. Example: We ordered chicken breasts and received chicken thigh meat. The package price was $15.24 but InstaCart price was $37.60, a difference of over $22.00. We notified them through their order/issue option 5 days ago but have not heard anything from them other than an acknowledgement of receipt. We will never use them again and would not recommend them to anyone! As a senior citizen who suffers from chronic asthma, a grocery delivery service at this time seemed to be a godsend, but this experience has proven to be more hellish than necessary. Our Costco groceries totalled $343.10 but our InstaCart Bill was $452.40 for a difference of over $109.00.

I gave one star even though the delivery driver did his job well because I feel robbed by this company!

NEVER, EVER again!								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1417,Ann S.,1.0 star rating,Let the buyer beware: Instacart and Albertsons cheated me,"								We used Instacart 4 times before we discovered the scam. This last time, the delivery person left his receipt in our grocery bag. He paid $61.58 for our groceries. Add in the fees and tip added another $15.86 to the bill for a total of $77.44. Instagram charged us $95! I complained and was told Albertsons is to blame. Are they? I compared the shopping prices and noted most of the prices jacked up (circled in the photos with the price difference at the sides). I am appalled and livid. This cannot be legal.								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#881,Gayle P.,1.0 star rating,Big Rip Off,"								My bill from Costco was $37.54. Instacart billed each food item at about 1/3 more than what the Costco receipt showed, so my credit card was actually charged $47.92. There was no warning that this would be done. I added a pix of Costco bill here but am unable to attach the higher Instacart bill because it only shows up when I opened my credit card online. I would not be aware of what happened had I not went to my credit card site. The delivery man did not give me their bill but instead had me sign on a phone pad with no bill attached. Never again!								
							"

I received my purchase on March 24,2020 from Publix (instacart express) and in one of those plastic bags with vegetables was a half bitten plum. The incredible and worrying thing about this, is that I don't order plums and that they come bite. I had to throw them away. I have the photo The publix postal code is 34741

They just don't deliver. I don't mind them not showing up but why take our money and waste our time.

I already pay a delivery fee AND a separate tip. I paid 15 dollars on average for this stupid service fee. I experimented and when I bought the exact same ingredients at the store i paid 67.43 less than with your stupid fees! You already increase the cost of each item from the price in store for even more profit. This should be illegal. Not a happy customer!

I would have payed Walmart or Amazon prime paying 12.99 and get may other benefit along with the proper items. I don't how Costco allow these kind of fraud company.

Our Costco groceries totalled $343.10 but our InstaCart Bill was $452.40 for a difference of over $109.00.

Our Costco groceries totalled $343.10 but our InstaCart Bill was $452.40 for a difference of over $109.00.

We will never use them again and would not recommend them to anyone! As a senior citizen who suffers from chronic asthma, a grocery delivery service at this time seemed to be a godsend, but this experience has proven to be more hellish than necessary. Our Costco groceries totalled $343.10 but our InstaCart Bill was $452.40 for a difference of over $109.00.

Example: We ordered chicken breasts and received chicken thigh meat. The package price was $15.24 but InstaCart price was $37.60, a difference of over $22.00. We notified them through their order/issue option 5 days ago but have not heard anything from them other than an acknowledgement of receipt. We will never use them again and would not recommend them to anyone! As a senior citizen who suffers from chronic asthma, a grocery delivery service at this time seemed to be a godsend, but this experience has proven to be more hellish than necessary. Our Costco groceries totalled $343.10 but our InstaCart Bill was $452.40 for a difference of over $109.00.

Example: We ordered chicken breasts and received chicken thigh meat. The package price was $15.24 but InstaCart price was $37.60, a difference of over $22.00. We notified them through their order/issue option 5 days ago but have not heard anything from them other than an acknowledgement of receipt. We will never use them again and would not recommend them to anyone! As a senior citizen who suffers from chronic asthma, a grocery delivery service at this time seemed to be a godsend, but this experience has proven to be more hellish than necessary. Our Costco groceries totalled $343.10 but our InstaCart Bill was $452.40 for a difference of over $109.00.

I would have payed Walmart or Amazon prime paying 12.99 and get may other benefit along with the proper items. I don't how Costco allow these kind of fraud company.

Our Costco groceries totalled $343.10 but our InstaCart Bill was $452.40 for a difference of over $109.00.

Our Costco groceries totalled $343.10 but our InstaCart Bill was $452.40 for a difference of over $109.00.

We will never use them again and would not recommend them to anyone! As a senior citizen who suffers from chronic asthma, a grocery delivery service at this time seemed to be a godsend, but this experience has proven to be more hellish than necessary. Our Costco groceries totalled $343.10 but our InstaCart Bill was $452.40 for a difference of over $109.00.

Example: We ordered chicken breasts and received chicken thigh meat. The package price was $15.24 but InstaCart price was $37.60, a difference of over $22.00. We notified them through their order/issue option 5 days ago but have not heard anything from them other than an acknowledgement of receipt. We will never use them again and would not recommend them to anyone! As a senior citizen who suffers from chronic asthma, a grocery delivery service at this time seemed to be a godsend, but this experience has proven to be more hellish than necessary. Our Costco groceries totalled $343.10 but our InstaCart Bill was $452.40 for a difference of over $109.00.

Example: We ordered chicken breasts and received chicken thigh meat. The package price was $15.24 but InstaCart price was $37.60, a difference of over $22.00. We notified them through their order/issue option 5 days ago but have not heard anything from them other than an acknowledgement of receipt. We will never use them again and would not recommend them to anyone! As a senior citizen who suffers from chronic asthma, a grocery delivery service at this time seemed to be a godsend, but this experience has proven to be more hellish than necessary. Our Costco groceries totalled $343.10 but our InstaCart Bill was $452.40 for a difference of over $109.00.

https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1523,Nancy S.,1.0 star rating,Never Again,"								I have been using insta cart for awhile now and have had trouble in the past with them. They are the most unorganized, horrible customer service, and have NO listening skills. I had an order delivered today that had another shoppers stuff charged to my card. When I called they kept telling me it wasn't in my cart. No kidding! The shopper herself told me she billed someone else's groceries to my account. I will NEVER us insta cart again. Which means unless Kroger gets someone else I will not be using them for delivery either.

https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1398,Mark H.,1.0 star rating,Authorized Hold on my credit card,"								Purchased items valued at $152.07. This amount was taken from my account on May 18th. A day later, Instacart, then place a hold for $225. Now I am told it will take 2 -3 BUSINESS days before I receive the held funds! Never experienced this type of online transaction for retail purchases, perhaps its common in the Hotel industry for reservations. Crazy!								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#955,Karen H.,1.0 star rating,Delivers warm food that should be cold,"								I placed an order that included bacon. When they delivered the order, the bacon was room temperature. Ugh! Who knows how long it was sitting out. Unlike other delivery services, they did not have it specially wrapped or anything. Disgusted. Can't even get a hold of anyone unless you want to wait 2.5 hours which is what the automatic voice said. Not even an option to have an automatic call back. I will NEVER use Instacart again.

https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1342,divakar K.,1.0 star rating,Instacart price scam,"								It is almost equal to cheating. They rip the customer utilize this pandemic situation.
This service is a rip off they mark up the prices by 25%.
I purchased grocery at Costco from $342 (including tax and exclude tips) order in that actual price is 284(include tax) was their mark up. Almost 60$ more for one order i did 3 order till now. I would have payed Walmart or Amazon prime paying 12.99 and get may other benefit along with the proper items. I don't how Costco allow these kind of fraud company.								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#934,JM V.,1.0 star rating,"Instacart Doesn't Deliver, But Keeps Your Money","								Instacart was scheduled to deliver our order from Fred Meyers between 9:00 pm and 10:00 pm on 03/24/2020. At 8:44 PM we were messaged that there were delays and the groceries would be delivered by 11:30 PM. At midnight, we finally gave up waiting for the delivery. Instacart never delivered our groceries or contacted us again about the delivery. Now their website says that there is no driver listed for our order. We are working with our Credit Union to cancel payment.								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1107,Nancy F.,1.0 star rating,Read these reviews!,"								I agree with the other low raters here! I tried Instacart today for the first time, and it was definitely a bad experience! The shopper woman made several mistakes, charged me too much, and now I have to wait up to 7 days for my adjustment from the $170 the co. Automatically charges to get started. Scary to think I won't be getting this refund because of everything else negative from today! NEVER AGAIN!								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1659,John B.,1.0 star rating,Allows fraudulent purchases for hundreds of dollars to made on your account. STAY AWAY!,"								THREE TIMES I have had shoppers fail to deliver entire orders and made FRAUDULENT purchases on my account that I had to call support to have reversed. It seems this is a common scam that shoppers are permitted to carry out repeatedly without consequences. The customer service phone number sends you to email and disconnects. Horrible, disorganized, DANGEROUS company that should not be allowed to do business in the US.

https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1044,Gary E.,1.0 star rating,Scammed Twice,"								I've ""tried' to use instacart during this virus epidemic to keep my family safe. First time they delivered
To wrong address and told me tough. Fortunately, I found the address and was able to get the order.
Second time, they only delivered 1/2 the order yet charged me for the full order and will not respond or
Reply. I've forwarded case to Police and Sheriff's Office for prosecution. This is fraud by means of interstate
Commerce folks. A federal felony.								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1199,Catherine K.,1.0 star rating,No Customer service response,"								I was overcharged on my initial grocery order and was charged for an item I didn't order. After contacting CS twice I still haven't heard from them. I am now past their 7 day window for refunds. Obvious that this company is overwhelmed with the current situation but if you can't handle the extra business you need to let go of it.								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1068,Jamie T.,1.0 star rating,Gone down steeply,"								I've been using the service for a couple of years, and would generally give 4 stars. However, the service has slipped to zero in the past couple of weeks. They've been busy i. E. making more money, but new hires are not being trained properly, there is no customer service by phone or online and I don't know if the site has crashed. This is new. I've been trying to follow up a complaint about wrong items delivered on April 1. Here it is April 6 and I still can not get anyone to straighten it out. Really, really bad.								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1589,Kaylen T.,1.0 star rating,Awful company to work for,"								Awful awful awful. They allow the customer to decide if you keep your job or not. The customers continually lie and say they didn't get this or that or something was damaged with no photo proof and that automatically drops the driver down. $#*! system. Terrible company. They over charge by at least 10 cents on every single item sometimes much much more. Do not spend your money here.								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1136,M S.,1.0 star rating,Bad customer service,"								Driver delivered to wrong address. No follow up from driver or instacart in the past 48 hours of my consistent reaching out. Could have been solved simply by returning and redelivering to correct address. Driver was aware of mistake within after his departure. Instacart's lack of ownership of the issue has led the elderly waiting another week for their grocery delivering during this worldwide pandemic.								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1146,samuel k.,1.0 star rating,Instacart delivered grocery to wrong address,"								Instacart shopper delivered to wrong address. I live in house. Text message showed he dropped off apartment 12. Why? Our address is 1012. He assumed last 12 is apartment number and went incorrect address and could not find right address-- rather than dragging grocery; he dropped off grocery to the stranger.
Attached picture is not my house's front porch. I complained to the website link; but no response for 7 days.
I called credit card to file a dispute claim. What a irresponsible company!
Make sure you use credit card if you have to use this company-- no paypal or venmo -- just in case.								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#893,Debbie Q.,1.0 star rating,"Double charged my credit card, & charged for items did not recieve","								1st mistake, Instacart is a third party, not affiliated with local grocery stores. Instagram double charged my credit card $210.00 for $83.00 actually spent. And I had 1 item missing that they charged me for. I ordered 43 items and they only delivered 20 items. Their prices they charge consumer are outrageous. They home up prices the actual sore prices are lower. What crooks! I will not use instacart again.								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1585,S K.,1.0 star rating,Don't use this service,"								I have used Instacart about 6 times and it is never a good experience. First, they put an estimated hold on your account even when you cancel an order. Secondly, it is so hit or miss - mostly miss about what you get. I just received ordered 12 things, three they just canceled, 2 they replaced with something else, and 4 they brought the wrong items. So of what I ordered only 3 were correct. I can't call anyone and this terrible. Last time I use them.								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1197,Sharon M.,1.0 star rating,Price Gouging or Highway Robbery?,"								We ordered groceries from Costco for delivery using InstaCart in Powder Springs GA. The markup on each item was outrageous. The shopper needlessly substituted cheaper/lesser products but the price difference was not reflected in my final bill. Example: We ordered chicken breasts and received chicken thigh meat. The package price was $15.24 but InstaCart price was $37.60, a difference of over $22.00. We notified them through their order/issue option 5 days ago but have not heard anything from them other than an acknowledgement of receipt. We will never use them again and would not recommend them to anyone! As a senior citizen who suffers from chronic asthma, a grocery delivery service at this time seemed to be a godsend, but this experience has proven to be more hellish than necessary. Our Costco groceries totalled $343.10 but our InstaCart Bill was $452.40 for a difference of over $109.00.

I gave one star even though the delivery driver did his job well because I feel robbed by this company!

NEVER, EVER again!								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1417,Ann S.,1.0 star rating,Let the buyer beware: Instacart and Albertsons cheated me,"								We used Instacart 4 times before we discovered the scam. This last time, the delivery person left his receipt in our grocery bag. He paid $61.58 for our groceries. Add in the fees and tip added another $15.86 to the bill for a total of $77.44. Instagram charged us $95! I complained and was told Albertsons is to blame. Are they? I compared the shopping prices and noted most of the prices jacked up (circled in the photos with the price difference at the sides). I am appalled and livid. This cannot be legal.								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#881,Gayle P.,1.0 star rating,Big Rip Off,"								My bill from Costco was $37.54. Instacart billed each food item at about 1/3 more than what the Costco receipt showed, so my credit card was actually charged $47.92. There was no warning that this would be done. I added a pix of Costco bill here but am unable to attach the higher Instacart bill because it only shows up when I opened my credit card online. I would not be aware of what happened had I not went to my credit card site. The delivery man did not give me their bill but instead had me sign on a phone pad with no bill attached. Never again!

I received my purchase on March 24,2020 from Publix (instacart express) and in one of those plastic bags with vegetables was a half bitten plum. The incredible and worrying thing about this, is that I don't order plums and that they come bite. I had to throw them away. I have the photo The publix postal code is 34741
My delivery time was 1:55 and the driver's name is Fernando								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#963,DENISE C.,1.0 star rating,WAIT AND NO DELIVERY 140 min WAIT FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE,"								I received 10 emails saying my order was delayed and ultimately the order was NEVER received... Status remained as ""Fred is shopping"". I know we are in a pandemic but companies that say they are going to deliver food to people who cant get out of house should carry through. NO COMMUNICATION. Estimated wait time on Customer Service line 140 minutes

https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#838,Phil B.,1.0 star rating,Instacart - would not recommend. Poor service.,"								I wish I had read Jennifer K. Review below before we put our trust in #instacart and #safeway to deliver. We are in Colorado and basically had the same experience.
They just don't deliver. I don't mind them not showing up but why take our money and waste our time.
Very disappointed that a good firm like Safeway #*******@safeway affiliates with this type of fly by night organization.
Simple message... stay away.								
							"
https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/instacart.com#1363,Adam L.,1.0 star rating,Take your service fees and shove them up your...,"								The addition of the service fee on every order to pay your platform costs, background checks etc is absolutely ludicrous! I already pay a delivery fee AND a separate tip. I paid 15 dollars on average for this stupid service fee. I experimented and when I bought the exact same ingredients at the store i paid 67.43 less than with your stupid fees! You already increase the cost of each item from the price in store for even more profit. This should be illegal. Not a happy customer!
